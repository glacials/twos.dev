# From Google to Apple

_From Apple to Google_ is a subsection of twos.dev where I detail my multi-year journey of migrating from deep in the Google ecosystem to deep in the Apple ecosystem. My hope is that this can serve as one of many sources to help other deep-ecosystem people decide whether or not switching is something they want to consider.

This subsite is continually updated. You can find each page’s creation date and (if any) last-updated date at the top.

Do not read this subsite in order. Skip around to the products you’re interested in or are weary about.

Some moves are not one-to-one, like Android → iPhone being a software change and Pixel → iPhone being a hardware change, but if one change requires the other (iPhone must run iOS) then I’ll address the move as a whole.

One last thing. In general I’ve found Apple products to be fine individually but shine together. On each page, I list some of these ecosystem effects. These lists are not complete, but they are a representative sample of the ones I notice in my daily life. Do not take the length of these lists into account when judging a product.
