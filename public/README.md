# `public`

This directory contains files that are deployed verbatim,
with directory structure intact.
It is used to hold files that must not be preprocessed,
as compared to those in `src`.

This can be used to enforce
"[cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)"
when, for example,
refactoring where or whether some files are generated.
