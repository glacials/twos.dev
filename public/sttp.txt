RFC 0001: Snail Text Transfer Protocol (STTP)

A Protocol for the Analog Transfer of Textual Correspondence

Author: Benjamin Carlsson
Date: June 28, 2025
Status: Draft

---

Abstract

The Snail Text Transfer Protocol (STTP), or "snail://", defines an
analog-friendly structure for many-to-many distribution of handwritten
letters, delivered by mail carriers, through a multiplexer. STTP
promotes clarity, conversational threading, community engagement, and
authenticity.

---

Motivation

Conventional post allows letters to be sent one-to-one, and services
exist that allow one-to-many (e.g. for marketing), but the
many-to-many structure resembling a public forum has long been held only
by highly curated publishers like journals.

Simple conventions inspired by digital protocols such as HTTP and SMTP
define STTP with the goal of enriching the experience of analog
correspondence, enhancing readability, and supporting organized
exchanges.

---

STTP Structure

Each STTP-compliant letter MUST include the following fields clearly
presented as a header at the beginning of the first page:

Field: Description (Example)

* From: The name or alias of the author (Ben Carlsson)
* Date: Date of writing (ISO or full month/day/year format) (2025-06-28
  or June 28, 2025)
* Category: Topical label for categorization, optional (Travel, Advice,
  Poetry)
* In-Reply-To: Letter ID this letter responds to, optional (Letter #23)
* Signature: Unique hand-drawn symbol or stamp for sender identity
  (\[Doodle of a wave])

Fields MUST be clearly separated and legible.

Example STTP Header:

From: Ben Carlsson
Date: 2025-06-28
Category: Announcement
In-Reply-To: Letter #57
Signature: [Tree symbol]

Server Responsibilities

The Server, the central entity facilitating STTP correspondence, has the
following responsibilities:

* Receive physical letters from authors via postal services.
* Assign and clearly mark a unique numeric identifier (Letter ID) on
  each letter upon receipt.
* Maintain an organized archive of all letters received, enabling future
  reference and retrieval.
* Distribute copies of letters to subscribers, adhering to subscriber
  preferences and subscription details.
* Provide subscribers with Letter IDs to enable accurate referencing and
  threading in replies.
* Manage categorization, cataloging letters according to provided
  metadata (if available).
* Serve as a mediator, ensuring letters are clearly legible and
  structured according to STTP guidelines before distribution.

---

Author Responsibilities

* SHOULD ensure letters are handwritten to maintain the analog integrity
  of the STTP correspondence.

---

Letter Identification

Upon receipt, each letter is assigned a unique numeric identifier
(Letter ID), sequentially incremented, which can be referenced in future
correspondence. The letter IDs are handwritten on the letter upon
cataloging by the Server.

---

Reply and Threading Conventions

Replies to existing letters SHOULD reference the original letter’s ID in
the "In-Reply-To" field. This convention creates conversational threads,
aiding clarity and historical reference.

---

Verification and Signatures

Authors are encouraged to adopt a consistent, unique hand-drawn symbol
or stamp as a signature for informal identity verification. This fosters
authenticity and personal recognition across multiple letters from the
same author.

Note on Authenticity and Verification: While STTP encourages unique
signatures or stamps to maintain consistent identity, purely analog
methods cannot provide mathematically rigorous cryptographic security.
Participants should treat authenticity verification as informal, based
on consistency of handwriting, signature style, stamps or marks, and
contextual trust built over time.

---

Categories

Authors MAY optionally categorize letters by topic or style, assisting
recipients in anticipating letter content and building personal
archives.

Examples include:

* Poetry
* Project Update
* Advice
* Recipe
* Short Story
* Reflection

---

Implementation and Compliance

Compliance is entirely voluntary but strongly encouraged. STTP aims to
enrich analog correspondence and foster a vibrant, engaged community
through simplicity and thoughtful exchange.

---

Future Considerations

* Standardizing optional metadata (location, mood, or medium)
* Defining formal archival conventions
* Developing physical indexing and searching mechanisms

Community Feedback

This RFC welcomes comments, improvements, and suggestions from the STTP
community via the official postal address provided on the project’s
