    <div style="white-space: pre-wrap">April 2020

I've worked from home for my last three jobs and see friends having trouble, so I thought I'd get my mental tricks on paper.

--

When you work from home you have the freedom to play video games as a break, or to fix a bug while you're in bed. This is okay! But long term you are training your brain to wander to play during work time and vice versa.

To counteract this, insert friction between your play and work time. Some people have a room dedicated to work. I don't have a room to spare, so I crack open a beer to signal the end of work. The act of going downstairs and getting it gives my brain the breathing room to context switch to play mode before I get back upstairs to the same chair I work in.

Once that beer is open, work melts away from my mind. You can also change your chair or put on different clothes or have a "how was your day" conversation with a significant other or roommate. It doesn't matter, as long as it's friction. You can't streamline this part away. It works because it's not streamlined.

Being at home means you're available to be popped in on by those you live with. Working means you're available to be popped in on by those you work with. Working from home gives you double the chance that a pop-in will happen. For me, even the anxiety of those pop-ins makes it harder to get into the zone.

Start treating your work time as opaque. Delay home requests and chores "until your lunch break" or "until after work". Say the words. Pretend you are at work. Not just working. At work. Physically absent people can't take out the trash or walk the dog. Schedule your day as if you were out of the house.

Turn on your webcam in all meetings and leave it on no matter what. When your webcam is on, people understand you. People pay attention to you. And people don't forget you. When your webcam is on, other people turn their webcams on -- maybe not this meeting, but eventually.

It's not for you, it's for them. Nobody cares how you look. Have you ever thought to yourself "Wow, that person is ugly today?" about one of your coworkers? No, you haven't, and they won't think that about you either, because they're all busy worrying about themselves.

Don't have a webcam? You work on a computer. Get a webcam. Sorry, we're not accepting that excuse anymore.

Lighting matters 100x more than the hardware in your webcam. And two rules of lighting matter 100x more than others:

1. Do everything you can to use natural light.
2. The light should shine on the subject, but the webcam shouldn't see the light source.

That's it. You'll have video better than anyone else in the call. The perfect setup is a window directly behind your webcam, such that you are looking directly out the window and the webcam is looking directly away from it. As a bonus, you can look outside and long for it while cooped up in meetings.

It doesn't matter which cardinal direction your window is facing. It doesn't matter if your geography doesn't get much sunlight. Natural light is still going to be 10x to 100x better than artificial light for 99% of situations.

When you don't use headphones in a meeting, one of two things happens:

1. When others speak, their audio comes out your speakers and goes directly back into your microphone, causing echo or even feedback.

2. Your computer or conferencing software tries to prevent echo by muting your microphone when you are listening to others, and muting your speakers when you are speaking. While better, this means you cannot hear anyone until you stop talking for a second or so. This can cause unintentional filibusters, where people are unable to stop the speaker in the middle of a thought, and the speaker keeps going because no one is stopping them.

The worst part about these problems is you won't know you have them unless someone has the guts to tell you, and that's rare. Use headphones.

Don't be that person that keeps picking up their cat and moving it away because it got in the frame. We like seeing your cat. We prefer seeing your cat. Don't be embarrassed about owning an asshole for a pet, everyone understands.

--

Depending on your profession and location you may be able to deduct things like internet, power, and even a whole room's proportion of rent from your taxes. Do your research, it's a good deal. Most tax software has these paths built in.

--

Working from home is hard. Reward your good behavior to reinforce it. Positive reinforcement works even when it's self-administered. Don't wear pants. Take a nap between meetings. Watch Netflix while eating lunch. You can't just avoid the downsides of working from home, you need to embrace the upsides to make it work.
