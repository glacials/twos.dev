            <div class="blog-post-meta">July 26, 2019</div>
            <p>
              I worked at <a href="https://twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> for five years. Here's what I came away with: <b>I
              don't like being data-driven</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data is nice. It helps you make decisions. But I see companies experimenting, A/B testing, whittling down
              every decision into a data-driven perfection sent from the heavens. Every little thing gets stalled at the
              "Can we show this in data?" phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's abused. Leaning on data too much is a death trap. Data-driven development doesn't charm users, or make them feel
              butterflies in their stomach. And I hate it.
            </p>
            <p>I hate it for two reasons.</p>
            <h2>1. It's ignorant</h2>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pro tip: If anyone suggests a design change you don&#39;t like, just say &quot;Do you have any data to back that up?&quot; Nobody knows how to answer this question.</p>&mdash; Mark Dalgleish (@markdalgleish) <a href="https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/1149572034705231872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            <p>
              It's pompous to think you can track everything you need to make good decisions. An example I like to use
              when I talk about this is <i>Assassin's Creed</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Assassin's Creed</i> (the first one) was a risky move for a game developer to make, and it paid off! It
              had its shortcomings, but all risks do. It had interesting tech and it was a fresh genre.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="img/assassins-creed.png" class="img-fluid" />
              <div class="text-muted small">
                I remember being flabbergasted at the crowdplay in the <i>Assassin's Creed</i> E3 demo, like pushing
                crowdmembers out of the way or hiding in a group of them to avoid guards.
                <a href="https://youtu.be/S0k2oSu-nSo?t=267" class="text-muted">
                  source
                </a>
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>Assassin's Creed II</i> trilogy resolved some of those shortcomings and took some more risks.
              Great! That's what a sequel to a risky game should do (see: <i>Portal 2</i>).
            </p>
            <p>
              By <i>Assassin's Creed III</i>, it was clear that Ubisoft had taken this series under a different
              wing&mdash;the "Oh, it's successful?" wing, whose responsibility is to milk the cow. Things didn't change
              much in <i>Assassin's Creed</i> games after that. They had the perfect cow, and now they could sell milk.
              Just whatever you do, don't disturb the cow!
            </p>
            <p>
              The games started looking more or less like a yearly sports game. Ubisoft announced proudly that it had
              spun up a second <i>Assassin's Creed</i> team, so they could trade off releasing every year. Wow! What a
              great idea.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Assassin's Creed</i> games started <i>sucking</i>. They were meticulously crafted time sinks. Just
              fun enough to keep you playing, and not one iota more. I started despising my time spent running between
              continents that looked identical and quests that played out the same, but I didn't realize why I kept
              playing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>This is the fast food industry of gaming</b>. Cold, calculating, efficient&mdash;and effective!
              Assassin's Creed games are wildly successful because of this strategy. But it overlooks one thing.
            </p>
            <h3>Loyalty</h3>
            <p>
              People catch on. They realize they don't get true satisfaction out of the game, just satiation. It might
              last one game, or two, or ten, but eventually people catch on&mdash;consciously or not&mdash;and stop
              coming back.
            </p>
            <p>
              (Of course in the meantime boatloads of money have been made, but that's not the point of this article.)
            </p>
            <p>
              The opposite of this strategy is someone like Nintendo. <b>Nintendo doesn't give a shit.</b> They love
              making amazing games, data be damned. And I'll tell you what, if I had to choose between being data-driven
              like Ubisoft or not giving a flying fuck like Nintendo, I'll choose the latter every. goddamned. time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because you know what? Nintendo makes amazing shit. They take risks, they do weird stuff, and it sometimes
              flops. The Wii U was a flop. Jumping around your living room to play Wii was a flop. But they weren't
              mistakes. The Wii U was v0.5 of the Switch. Jumping around your living room turned into gyroscopic aiming.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="img/wii.jpg" class="img-fluid" />
              <div class="text-muted small">
                Nintendo's vision for families bonding and exercising over the Wii never really took off past the
                experimental honeymoon phase. And that's okay.
                <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/10/parent_trap_the_wii_is_still_crucial_to_family_game_success"

              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              Even ignoring flops that get eventually tuned, for every mistake they make Nintendo gets something right.
              The control stick. The 3D platformer. The twin-stick first-person shooter. The fucking <i>home video game
              system</i>. The handheld console. The open-world adventure game. The metroidvania. Without Nintendo out
              there taking risks, the video game industry would be data-driven pieces of shit from 30 years ago.
            </p>
            <h3>Gut-driven development</h3>
            <p>
              I want to be like Nintendo. Fuck data-driven. Why build a thing if it sucks? How about we don't build that
              thing? How about we build something that might be cool instead, and don't care about justifying it with
              data?
            </p>
            <p>
              When Nintendo released the Wii U, I did what I do every time Nintendo releases a console. I waited in line
              for 17 hours. It's always a hoot&mdash;my favorite was the Wii launch, with a few hundred people playing
              Mario Kart DS with random strangers only ten feet away, one guy playing relaxing acoustic guitar, and
              people getting hype together, in and out of sleep, serving each other cocoa, from the afternoon of the
              previous day until opening.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always arrived around 17 hours before release because it worked really well with me for the
              Gamecube&mdash;I'd been position 108 out of 120 available units, so I didn't waste much time being in line
              too early.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="img/wii-launch.jpg" class="img-fluid" />
              <div class="text-muted small">
                The chillest crowd.
                <a href="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/12437/los-angeles-wii-launch-report"
                  class="text-muted">

              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              But this time, for Wii U, something was different. I was first in line. And you know what? The second
              person in line didn't show up until two hours before opening. By the time the doors opened, only about 9
              more people showed up.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was thinking, What the fuck? This is nothing like the Wii launch. Where is everybody? What's going on?
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, spoiler alert, you know what was going on. The Wii U <i>sucked</i>. Not just as a console, but
              as a marketing push, and as a launch platform for games. Nothing really came out on it other than
              <i>Splatoon</i>, <i>Wind Waker HD</i>, and <i>Twilight Princess HD</i>, and those all took a while.
            </p>
            <p>
              So Nintendo failed me. I did what superfans do, I gave my heart, my time, and my money, and it was a
              let-down. </p>
            <p>I don't care. Look at this:</p>
            <div class="progress">
              <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated" role="progressbar"
                style="width: 98%" aria-valuenow="98" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="text-muted small">
              My loyalty bar towards Nintendo before the Wii U.
            </p>
            <p>Now look at this:</p>
            <div class="progress">
              <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated" role="progressbar"
                style="width: 95%" aria-valuenow="95" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="text-muted small">
              My loyalty bar towards Nintendo after the Wii U.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will still wait in line 17 hours next time a Nintendo console comes out.
            </p>
            <p>
              They've built this loyalty over many years, many games, many decisions, and so much love. If you brought
              an alien down to Earth and told them to group video games by style, Nintendo would stand out like a giant.
            </p>
            <p>Think about how <i>fucking insane</i> all of Animal Crossing is.</p>
            <p>
              <img src="img/animal-crossing.jpg" class="img-fluid" />
              <div class="text-muted small">
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/77tg02/a_n_i_m_a_l_c_r_o_s_s_i_n_g/" class="text-muted">

            </p>
            <p>
              Not because it increases Twitter interactions with their hashtag or some shit. Do you think Nintendo even
              knows what Twitter <i>is</i>? This is just the shit that comes out of their <i>brains</i>. You can't make
              it by looking at data.
            </p>
            <h3>Summarizing</h3>
            <p>
              Loyalty bars aren't exposed in data, at least not until a literal lifetime of good data collection goes
              by. But everyone has a loyalty bar. You have one. Your mom has one. That weird roommate you had in college
              that only plays Madden has one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every time a bad decision is made, it might reflect nicely in the data regardless of user opinion. If you
              make it hard for users to cancel their subscriptions, will fewer users cancel their subscriptions?
              Probably! Does that mean you should do it?
            </p>
            <p>
              I'll let you decide.
            </p>
            <h2>2. It's inefficient</h2>
            <p>
              If you're still convinced data-driven is the best goddamned thing in the world, this one's for you. Here's
              a data-driven way you can evaluate data-driven development. Please, <i>please</i> try this at
              home.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Being data-driven is hard.</b> If you know what you're doing, sure, you can write some SQL or use your
              user-friendly tool like Mixpanel or advanced Google Analytics shit to find out what the fucking favorite
              colors of users who land on your frontpage then go to the purchase page then don't follow through with the
              purchase are. Great! I'm proud of you.
            </p>
            <p>
              But all the shit that goes on <i>underneath</i> that&mdash;not just building the instrumentation, not just
              testing it, not just speccing it out, not <i>just</i> agreeing between people what should be reported and
              when, <i>not just</i> going through periodically and making sure everything you're reporting is consistent
              and well-formatted, <b><i>not just</i></b> dealing with typos in events and properties, and <b><i>not
              just</i></b> expending <i>all the extra effort</i> that you have to expend while building <i>every single
              feature</i> and <i>maintaining every previously-built feature</i>&mdash;oh wait I'm sorry, it <i>is</i>
              just all that.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's <i>hard</i>, person. Like 10x hard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Go ahead and make the 80/20 trade-off&mdash;put your Google Analytics snippet in your pages or whatever.
              But instrumenting every single tiny little thing is just not worth it.
            <p>
              The landscape that results from a data-driven setup is strictly better if you know how and when to use it
              (see: <i>1. It's ignorant</i>), but if you could ditch all that extra framework, scaffolding, and manpower
              in exchange for a 10x or 100x velocity on gut-driven features... wouldn't you?
            </p>
            <p>
              If your team while data-driven team can churn out a feature a month with a 75% hit rate, and while
              gut-driven team can churn out 10 or 100 features a month with a 25% hit rate... wouldn't you choose the
              latter? What about 90/10? 50/50? What's your team's ratio?
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't know the answer? <i>Run a fucking experiment.</i>
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Loyalty bars defy data. They're not special snowflakes, but they are really hard to measure, and they're
              orders of magnitude more important than the things that are easy to measure. But if you one day discovered
              users just wanted to be charmed and feel butterflies... forget the goddamned cursed data. Wouldn't you
              charm them and build butterflies?
