              I don't like how much stress is placed on being data-driven.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data is nice. It helps you make decisions. But I see companies experimenting, A/B testing, whittling down
              every decision into a data-driven perfection sent from the heavens. Every little thing gets stalled at the
              "Can we show this in data?" phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              And sure, data lets you know if users are making it through your funnel. But do you know anything deeper
              than that? Do you know if those users are being charmed, or feeling butterflies?
            </p>

              Everyone knows you can't track everything you need to make good decisions. But let's walk through an
              example: <i>Assassin's Creed</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first <i>Assassin's Creed</i> game was a risky move for a game developer to make, and it paid off! It
              had shortcomings, but all risks do. It had interesting tech and it was a fresh genre.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="img/assassins-creed.png" class="img-fluid" />
              <div class="text-muted small">
                I remember being flabbergasted at the crowdplay in the <i>Assassin's Creed</i> E3 demo, like pushing
                crowdmembers out of the way or hiding in a group of them to avoid guards.
                <a href="https://youtu.be/S0k2oSu-nSo?t=267" class="text-muted">
                  youtube
                </a>
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>Assassin's Creed II</i> trilogy resolved some of those shortcomings and took some more risks.
              Great! That's what a sequel to a risky game should do (see <i>Portal 2</i>).
            </p>
            <p>
              By <i>Assassin's Creed III</i>, it was clear that Ubisoft had taken this series under a different
              wing&mdash;the "Oh, it's successful?" wing, also known as the cow-milking wing. Things didn't change much
              in <i>Assassin's Creed</i> games after that. They had invented the perfect cow, and now they could sell
              milk.
            </p>
            <p>
              The games started looking more or less like yearly sports games. Ubisoft announced proudly that it had
              spun up a second <i>Assassin's Creed</i> team, so they could trade off releasing every year. Wow! What a
              great idea.
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't know about you, but it was around this time that I started finding myself disliking <i>Assassin's
              Creed</i> games, but still playing them&mdash;an interesting phenomenon to live through. They were
              meticulously crafted time sinks. Just fun enough to keep you playing, and not one iota more. </p>
            <p>
              <b>This is the fast food industry of gaming</b>. Cold, calculating, efficient&mdash;and effective!
              Assassin's Creed games are wildly successful because of this strategy. But it overlooks one thing.
            </p>
            <h3>Loyalty</h3>
            <p>
              People catch on. They realize they're only being sated, not satisfied. It might take one game, or two, or
              ten, but eventually people stop bothering to keep buying the games.
            </p>
            <p>
              The opposite of this strategy is Nintendo. <b>Nintendo doesn't give a shit.</b> They love making amazing
              games, data be damned.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because you know what? Nintendo makes amazing and unique games. They take risks, they do weird stuff, and
              it sometimes flops. But they never milk the cow too long before moving on. The Wii U was a flop. Jumping
              around your living room to play Wii was a flop. But they weren't mistakes. The Wii U was v0.5 of the
              Switch. Jumping around your living room turned into gyroscopic aiming.
            </p>

              <div class="text-muted small">
                Nintendo's vision for families bonding and exercising over the Wii never really took off past the
                experimental honeymoon phase. And that's okay.

            </p>
            <p>
              For every mistake, Nintendo gets something right. The control stick. The 3D platformer. The twin-stick
              first-person shooter. The <i>home video game system</i>. The handheld console. The open-world adventure
              game. The metroidvania. Where would the video game industry be if Nintendo's strategy was to milk the cow?
            </p>
            <p>
              Ubisoft and Nintendo are both successful companies by many measures, so it's hard to point at them and say
              "I like this one better, so the other one must be flawed". Any company as successful as Ubisoft must have
              done many things right, and far be it from me to tell them their philosophy is wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I'm a small business owner, so it's important for me to make sure <i>my</i> business's philosophy is
              in tune with my ideals.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to be like Nintendo. And I don't know for sure to what extent they use data, but anyone who's
              interacted with their software knows it's probably at least an order of magnitude less than your classic
              data-driven company.
            </p>
            <h3>Gut-driven development</h3>
            <p>
              I'll be honest, I chose Nintendo for this case study because I'm a Nintendo superfan, and if there's one
              place I'll let myself be biased it's on my own website explaining my own philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always get in line about 18 hours before any Nintendo console launches. It's super chill, people passing
              cocoa, playing guitar, and being thankful Nintendo launches don't show up in murder investigations, news
              stories about being trampled to death, and eBay listings at a 1,000% markup like the PlayStation and Xbox
              launches do.
            </p>

              <div class="text-muted small">
                The chillest crowd.
                <a href="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/12437/los-angeles-wii-launch-report"
                  class="text-muted">

            </p>
            <p>
              It's a small town's worth of people, but it feels like a community of chillfolk. But for the Wii U,
              something was different. No one else showed up. I had the cops called on my by (presumably) a store
              employee leaving for the night, thinking I was homeless. By the time the doors opened, only nine people
              had lined up.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was thinking <i>Where is everybody? Did I get the date right?</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, spoiler alert, everyone was home because the Wii U <i>sucked</i>. It was poorly marketed,
              poorly explained ("Wait, so it's an add-on for my Wii?") and had no hype launch games. The only three
              games worth buying the console over were <i>Splatoon</i>, <i>Wind Waker HD</i>, and <i>Twilight Princess
              HD</i>, none of which were launch games, and two of which people had already played.
            </p>
            <p>
              So Nintendo failed me. I'd done what superfans do: I gave my heart, my time, and my money, and it was all
              a big let-down.
            </p>
            <p>I don't care. Look at this:</p>
            <div class="progress">
              <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated" role="progressbar"

            <p class="text-muted small">
              My loyalty bar towards Nintendo before the Wii U.
            </p>
            <p>Now look at this:</p>
            <div class="progress">
              <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated" role="progressbar"
                style="width: 95%" aria-valuenow="95" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">

            </div>
            <p class="text-muted small">
              My loyalty bar towards Nintendo after the Wii U.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will still wait in line 18 hours the next time a Nintendo console comes out.
            </p>
            <p>Think about how <i>insane</i> Animal Crossing is.</p>
            <p>

              This is just what comes out of their <i>brains</i>. You can't make it by looking at data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loyalty bars aren't exposed in data, at least not until a literal lifetime of good data collection goes
              by. But everyone has one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every time a bad decision is made, it might reflect nicely in the data regardless of user opinion. If you
              make it hard for users to cancel their subscriptions, will fewer users cancel their subscriptions?
              Probably! Does that mean you should do it?
            </p>
            <h2>2. It's inefficient</h2>
            <p>
              If you're unconvinced, here's a data-driven way you can evaluate data-driven development. Try this at
              home.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Being data-driven is hard.</b> 
              The instrumentation, the extra tests, the extra specs, the coordination involved with them, agreeing what
              should be instrumented and when, periodically making sure everything you're instrumenting is consistent
              and well-formatted, dealing with typos in events and properties, and doing it for every feature and
              maintaining it for every previously-built feature certainly takes its toll.
            </p>
            <p>
              Go ahead and make the 80/20 trade-off&mdash;put your Google Analytics snippet in your pages or whatever.
              But instrumenting every single tiny little thing is just not worth it.
            <p>
              The landscape that results from a data-driven setup is strictly better if you know how and when to use it,
              but if you could ditch all that extra framework, scaffolding, and manpower in exchange for a 10x or 100x
              velocity on gut-driven features... wouldn't you?
            </p>
            <p>
              What if your team while data-driven team can churn out a feature a month with a 75% hit rate, but while
              gut-driven team can churn out 10 or 100 features a month with a 25% hit rate? Do you know what your team's
              velocity could be without this extra framework around their work?
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't know the answer? <i>Run an experiment.</i>
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Loyalty bars defy data. They're not special snowflakes, but they are really hard to measure, and they're
              orders of magnitude more important than the things that are easy to measure. But if you one day discovered
              users just wanted to be charmed and feel butterflies... wouldn't you charm them and build butterflies?
