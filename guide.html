  <p>
    this page describes my working and communication styles. [1]
  </p>

  <p>
    we are all different and each have our preferences. the below points are not
    demands, but ways to reduce friction with me. use or ignore at your
    discretion :)
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>be concise.</b> most ideas can fit in a tweet. most specs can fit on a
      page. i dump my unfiltered thoughts into my keyboard then spend most of my
      "writing" time deleting. for example, this bullet's first draft was three
      paragraphs.
      <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html">more</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>prefer sharing vision to coordinating.</b> coordination is slow. if we
      sync on where we're going rather than on how to get there, we will each be
      empowered to make decisions in motion without being blocked. and if we are
      good about sharing what we've learned in nonblocking ways like demos and
      email blasts, we can spread knowledge all the same. [2]
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>prefer non-interruptive communication.</b> a five-second slack convo
      can set my brain back 30 minutes. similarly, the best time to schedule a
      meeting with me is immediately before or after another meeting. <a

    </li>
    <li>
      <b>prefer talking in the ticket.</b> as a forgetful person i love
      single-origin paper trails.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>think in customer problems.</b> even if &lt;product&gt; "feels right"
      be prepared for me to ask what customer problem it solves. the one
      exception is tech debt, since we all know how it impacts customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>know when it's time to schedule a meeting.</b> antithetical to many of
      the above, async communication sometimes doesn't fit. it's:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>low bandwidth</b>: writing doesn't have inflection or body
          language. you need more words to convey the same idea. <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bFsqk84frI">more</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>high latency</b>: an idea that takes 30 back-and-forths to resolve
          may take weeks in writing but minutes in a meeting. meetings have
          <i>negative</i> latency because you can see people react before you've
          finished speaking, and adjust accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>high effort</b>: in writing you don't quite know if your sentence
          will be read the way you intend. but the round-trip-time is so high
          that you don't want to risk being misunderstood, so you add more words
          to clarify. these words take longer to write and to read.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>emotional</b>: i perceive people as meaner in writing than in
          meetings, and in response i become meaner. i don't want to and i try
          not to, but it can still happen. (please call me out on it.)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>give me feedback!</b> i love feedback. we all feel it's a little bit
      awkward to give feedback and i think that is dumb and you should help me
      break that norm.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>warnings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>i think slowly.</b> asking me to answer a complex question on the spot
      will be an "i don't know", but over the following minutes my brain will
      sometimes produce the answer. i can accelerate this by asking a flurry of
      questions. this means i'm excited to understand you. if this is stressing
      you out tell me, i don't blame you.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>i go rogue.</b> if i get a burst of motivation i'll sometimes do work
      without tracking it or checking with anyone. this is because i know the
      anxiety of shepharding it through the pipeline will outlast my burst of
      motivation. <a
        href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglcls%2Fstatus%2F720689621466619904&src=typed_query">some</a>
      of the most loved features i've built have come out of this.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>i work weird hours.</b> inspiration strikes randomly and sometimes it
      happens to be a sunday or 3am when it does. sometimes i'm in flow for 12
      hours. to counterbalance i shorten my standard workdays and the math ends
      up working out. however the odd email or commit from me may have a
      timestamp that looks unhealthy.
    </li>
