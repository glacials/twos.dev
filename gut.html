<p>
  A lot of stress is placed on being data-driven. Data is nice. It builds
  confidence in decisions. But it's often taken too far, beyond the point where
  diminishing returns have burned the marginal value away.
</p>
<p>I'd like to share an argument for pulling back the reins a little bit.</p>
<p>
  Data optimizes funnels. But funnels are influenced by far more than most data
  captures. Are the users being charmed and feeling butterflies, or are they
  just grumpy about needing to use a product they're planning to switch off next
  year? They're engaged, but do they like the product?
</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<h2>A Case Study</h2>
<blockquote>
  Pro tip: If anyone suggests a design change you don't like, just say "Do you
  have any data to back that up?" Nobody knows how to answer this question.

<p>
  Data-driven decisions are based entirely on proxies, so it can be hard to
  grasp exactly how much influences them behind the scenes. Let's walk through
  an example: <i>Assassin's Creed</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The first <i>Assassin's Creed</i> was a risky move for a game developer: a new
  team building the entire game on new technology in a new genre. It was not
  perfect, but the risk paid off.
</p>

<div class="gallery-item">
  <img alt="A screenshot of Assassin's Creed's crowdplay
mechanic." src="/img/gut-assassinscreed.png"/>
</div>

<i style="display: block; text-align: center">Assassin's Creed's crowdplay mechanic was unheard of at the time. (source:
  <a href="https://youtu.be/S0k2oSu-nSo?t=267" target="_blank">YouTube</a>)</i>
<p>
  The <i>Assassin's Creed II</i> trilogy resolved some shortcomings and took
  some more risks. That's what sequels to risky games are meant to do; see also
  <i>Portal 2</i>.
</p>
<p>
  But by <i>Assassin's Creed III</i>, it was clear Ubisoft had taken a different
  stance toward the series<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>the one that milks them dry. They had invented the
  perfect cow, and now they could sell milk.
</p>
<p>
  The games started looking like yearly sports games. Ubisoft announced proudly
  that it had spun up a second <i>Assassin's Creed</i> team so they could trade
  off releases every year. Wow! What a great idea.
</p>

<div class="gallery-item">
  <img alt="A timeline of Assassin's Creed teams, totaling at times six teams at once." src="/img/gut-acteams.png"/>
</div>

<i style="display: block; text-align: center">Once Assassin's Creed was proven, it became a well-oiled machine. (source:
  <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-multiple-ubisoft-studios-make-so-many-assassin-s-cr-1824298939" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>)
</i>

<p>
  This is pure opinion, but starting then, every other <i>Assassin's Creed</i>
  game was a dud, and the series as a whole was on a downward slope. They were
  meticulously crafted time sinks, just barely fun enough to keep playing.
</p>
<p>
  This is the fast food industry of gaming. Cold, calculating,
  efficient<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and effective! Assassin's Creed games are wildly successful
  because of this strategy. But it overlooks one thing.
</p>
<h2>Loyalty</h2>
<p>
  People catch on. They realize they're being sated, but not satisfied. It might
  take one game, or two, or ten, but eventually people silently stop bothering
  to keep buying the games.
</p>
<p>
  The opposite of this strategy is Nintendo. Nintendo doesn't give a shit. They
  love making amazing games, data be damned.
</p>
<p>
  They take risks, they do weird stuff, and it sometimes flops. But they never
  milk the cow. The Wii U was a flop. Jumping around your living room to play
  Wii was a flop. But they weren't mistakes. Each of them was a step towards the
  Switch.
</p>

<i style="display: block; text-align: center">
  Nintendo's family vision for the Wii never took off like they wanted. (source:

</i>

<p>
  For every mistake, Nintendo gets something right. The control stick. The 3D
  platformer. The twin-stick first-person shooter. The
  <i>home video game system</i>. The handheld console. The open-world adventure
  game. The metroidvania. Where would the video game industry be if Nintendo
  milked their cows?
</p>
<p>
  Ubisoft and Nintendo are both successful companies by many measures, so it's
  hard to point at them and say "I like this one better, so the other one must
  be flawed". Any company as successful as Ubisoft must have done many things
  right, and far be it from me to tell them their philosophy is wrong.
</p>
<p>
  But as someone with a couple of successful products, it's important for me to
  make sure my philosophy is in tune with my ideals.
</p>
<p>
  I want to be like Nintendo. And I don't know for sure to what extent they use
  data, but anyone who's interacted with their software a lot knows it's at
  least an order of magnitude less than a traditional tech company.
</p>
<h3>A Personal Aside</h3>
<p>
  I chose Nintendo as an example here because I like them. I line up about 18
  hours before any home Nintendo console launches. It's chill, with people
  passing cocoa, playing guitar, and being thankful Nintendo console launches
  don't yield near-death experiences and eBay scalpers like other console
  launches.
</p>

<div class="gallery-item">
  <img alt="A long but calm line of people waiting outside an EB Games, busy with their various devices." src="/img/gut-wiilaunch.jpg"/>
</div>

<i style="display: block; text-align: center">The chillest crowd. (source:
  <a href="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/12437/los-angeles-wii-launch-report" class="text-muted" target="_blank">Nintendo World Report</a>)
</i>

<p>
  It was this chillfolk vibe for the Gamecube, the Nintendo DS, and the Wii. But
  for the Wii U, something was different. No one else showed up. I sat alone in
  the dark all night. An unseen concerned citizen, presumably an employee not
  knowing why I was there, called the cops on me. By the time the doors opened,
  only nine people had lined up, all after sunrise.
</p>
<p>
  At those wee hours into the night, staving off sleep with excitement and hot
  cocoa, I remember thinking
  <i>Where is everybody? Did I get the date right?</i>.
</p>
<p>
  I did. There was no one there because the Wii U was horribly marketed ("So
  it's an add-on for Wii?") and had no launch games worth buying one for.
  Nintendo failed me. I'd done what superfans do: I gave my heart, my time, and
  my money, and it was all a big let-down.
</p>
<p>I don't care. Look at this:</p>
<center><code> ----------------------------------- </code></center>
<p>
  That's my loyalty bar towards Nintendo before the Wii U. Now look at this:
</p>
<center><code> ----------------------------- </code></center>
<p>
  That's my loyalty bar towards Nintendo after the Wii U. Only a handful of
  brands in my life can take a hit like that. <i>Assassin's Creed</i> certainly
  isn't one of them.
</p>
<h4>Nintendo and Risks</h4>
<p>
  Nintendo takes crazy risks based on what sometimes feel like acid trip ideas.
  Think about the premise of Animal Crossing for a second.
</p>

<div class="gallery-item">
  <img alt="A meme comic where a racoon asks a stranger to buy a house." src="/img/gut-animalcrossing.jpg"/>
</div>

<i style="display: block; text-align: center">
  The premise of Animal Crossing. (source:
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/77tg02/a_n_i_m_a_l_c_r_o_s_s_i_n_g/" target="_blank">reddit</a>)
</i>
<p>
  You can't make this up by looking at data, but it worked, and it filled
  loyalty bars. These bars aren't exposed in data, at least not until a lifetime
  of it passes you by. But everyone has one.
</p>
<p>
  Bad decisions can reflect well on the data while still being bad decisions. If
  you make it impossible for users to cancel their subscriptions, will fewer
  users cancel their subscriptions? Probably! Does that mean you should do it?
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Being data-driven is hard. Adding instrumentation and A/B tests, along with
  extra specs, coordination, and maintenance takes a lot of time that could be
  spent building.
</p>
<p>
  Try making the 80/20 trade-off. Put an analytics snippet in your footer or
  whatever the trend is nowadays. But ditch the experiments framework,
  scaffolding, headache, and personpower in exchange for a 10x velocity on
  gut-driven features.
</p>
<p>
  Hard-to-measure things like loyalty bars defy the charts, but are at least as
  important as them. If you one day discovered users just wanted to be charmed
  and feel butterflies, wouldn't you charm them and build butterflies?

<p>If you're unconvinced, run an A/B test.</p>
