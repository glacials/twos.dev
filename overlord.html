<h1>Overlord</h1>

<p>A second game I’ve been trying to play lately is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_%282007_video_game%29">Overlord</a>, which,
despite its lack of hype (that I’ve heard of, anyway), is actually a pretty
great game (then again, it came out almost six months ago). I’ve been told by my
fellow blogger that it’s extremely similar to Pikmin, which I, of course, never
bought.In short, you play as a dark overlord (who would guess?), and you do
battle by sending in your minions, who are a little like demonic gremlins, to
fight for you. You have a huge axe you can fight with too, but according to your
advisor, you’re too good for that.</p>

<p>An appealing part of the game is the number of uses for the minions, and the
awesome ways in which they’re applied. Aside from fighting (which can get pretty
awesome, what with your minions jumping onto your enemies’ backs and pretty much
riding them around), the minions can do things like move large obstacles out of
the way (which will require x minions to do depending on the size of the object;
this makes for the revelation of new areas pretty smooth as you can command more
and more minions at once), turn big wheels to open doors or drop drawbridges,
and fit through or across small areas like tunnels or coincidental bridges made
of small tree branches.</p>

<p>Your minions also pick up random stuff that can help them along their way,
ranging from makeshift weapons (like pieces of fences, if I remember correctly)
to pumpkin helms. That’s right; if you tell your minions to attack random things
(which they will sometimes do on their own if they’re in the area) <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> like
pumpkins <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> they’ll do crazy stuff like put them on their heads, even if it
doesn’t help them one bit. That’s one of the things that really brings them to
life: they’re not just mindless creatures who obey your every word and only your
every word (although they are quite loyal) <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> they like to have some fun, too.</p>

<p>You also have a huge castle that you can customize with enough money <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> a nice
perk, but (so far for me) has served no super-meaningful purpose.</p>

<p>And the last thing I’ll mention is paths. Lots of games have been adding this
lately to dynam-ify storylines <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> you can choose your character’s personal path
through the the actions you perform. In most cases, your actions end up deciding
whether you’re good or evil in the end (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Messiah_of_Might_and_Magic">Dark
Messiah</a> is an
excellent example of this), but since <em>Overlord</em>‘s whole concept is pretty much
based around being evil, you get to choose between evil and <em>really</em> evil.</p>

<p>As you might guess, killing innocent people leans you towards the <em>really evil</em>
side. Every time you kill someone who would otherwise befriend you, you get
their life force, and 1 life force = 1 more minion you have available to summon.
You also get some decent cash from their pockets.</p>

<p>The disadvantage to doing this, as your advisor states, is that to rule an evil
empire, you actually have to have <em>people</em> to rule over <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> so killing everyone
isn’t too much of an option. I have yet to complete the game, so I’m not sure of
the gameplay differences between the two paths yet, but I’m sure there will be
some.</p>

<p>One last thing, because I know you’re waiting for it: graphics. They’re <em>very</em>
decent. If you’re talking about sole graphics, they’re up there with Half-Life
2, but that doesn’t take into account physics, the actual <em>use</em> of the graphics,
and the cooperation between the two. And some unrelated things could use some
work.</p>

<p>For instance, you can set fields of dry grass on fire once you get the
appropriate spell, and the trees in that field will switch to a dry and burnt
model when the fire spreads to them (which all is very cool to see happen), but
the trees just swap from one model to the other, and the instant change is very
noticeable. At least cross-fade between the models or something.</p>

<p>Definitely not something to cry over, though <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> from the first time you set foot
into non-evil lands, you can feel the happiness vibes emitting from everything
from the sheep to the swaying grass <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> one of which you will slaughter and the
other of which you will set fire to.</p>
