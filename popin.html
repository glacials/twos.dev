  <h1>the remote pop-in</h1>

  <p>
    this page describes a method of dealing with one of the missing features of
    fully remote teams: the pop-in.

    <!-- TODO: make another about social time re: hallway conversations -->
  </p>

  <h2>the pop-in</h2>
  <p>
    the pop-in, back before open floorplans, is when you physically walk into
    someone's office to ask them a question or spitball an idea. in an open
    floorplan it is swiveling your chair or walking to their desk.
  </p>
  <p>
    the pop-in is valuable because it's as informal as email, but as
    high-bandwidth and low-latency as meetings. it's interruptive to the
    pop-innee, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of
    physically going somewhere is high, and social dynamics can add cost if,
    say, the pop-innee isn't having a good day.
  </p>
  <p>
    slack dms attempted to replace the pop-in, but they reduced the effort
    needed of the pop-inner too much. the reduction in effort leads to more
    interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot higher in number) and
    even to the replacement of better-suited mediums like trackers, emails, and
    wikis with slack dms.
  </p>
  <p>
    there's a lot wrong with pop-ins, but like any tool they have their uses.
    many great products&mdash;companies, even&mdash;have been built on the
    shoulders of the pop-in.
  </p>
  <h2>The Remote Pop-in</h2>
  <p>
    There's really no remote equivalent. There are some products that help you
    "hang out" like facebook portal, but nothing addressed the pop-in.
  </p>
  <p>
    at <a href="https://yourbase.io">yourbase</a> we decided we needed one.
    rather than build another tool, we experimented with discord. i'm happy to
    say we found something that worked, and even solves the worst problem of
    open-office pop-ins&mdash;the inability to shut your damned door.
  </p>
  <h3>The Setup</h3>
  <p>
    In our company Discord server, we give everyone one voice channel of their
    own. This is your "office". When you are online and able to be disturbed,
    you join your office, alone. You stay in there as long as you are "in".
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of how Discord works, everyone can see who is in what office at all
    times. but you can only hear conversations for the room you're in. Joining a
    room plays an obvious audio chime and is not something you can do sneakily.
  </p>
  <p>
    When someone wants to pop-in, they join your voice channel. The chime plays,
    they say hello, you unmute and turn on video if you like, and have your
    pop-in. And that's really it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're going to the restroom and will be AFK, you can join the restroom
    channel. You're in, but away. No one is actually wearing a headset on the
    toilet, it's just a fun way to feel like a real office.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've even accidentally fallen into some typical office
    behaviors:
  <ul>
    <li>
      we've started having meetings in people's offices just
      because it's easier
    </li>
    <li>
      we have a "cafeteria" room where you can eat your lunch if you've got
      nothing going on irl
    </li>
    <li>
      we have a "rooftop" and other common spaces where some people chill, which
      signals that they're open for a chat
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The oddest one is that when it's slow around the office, you can tell. And
    you can almost hear how quiet it is when you're the first one in or the last
    one out.
  </p>
  <p>
    this system has worked well for us, and we didn't have to build any more
    tools. thanks to discord for making such a flexible platform.
