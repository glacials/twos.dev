      <article><html><head></head><body><h1>Dashes over the Years</h1>

<p>There are three common dashes in English written language:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyphen : <span style="font-family: sans-serif">-</span></li>
<li>En dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span></li>
<li>Em dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span></li>
</ul>

<p>A myth states the em dash is so named because its width is exactly one <code>M</code>, but this is not quite correct. An em dash is so named because its width is exactly <code>1em</code>.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)">em</a> is the current font point size, e.g. <code>16pt</code>. The point size determines the height of the character bounding box in pixels. Because the em dash&#39;s length is defined as <code>1em</code>, its bounding box will always be an exact square<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>in any font, at any size.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:emorigins"><a href="#fn:emorigins">1</a></sup></p>

<p>One en is defined as half the width of one em.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The hyphen is used to hyphenate words or otherwise join parts of a whole, like father-in-law.</p>

<p>The en dash is used to create ranges, like 2020<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2030.</p>

<p>The em dash is used like a parenthetical<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>to separate one thought from another<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>when the thought needs to stand out (more than a typical parenthetical).</p>

<h3>A Note About the Em Dash</h3>

<p>Em dashes tend to be a trap when a writer first learns to jive with them. They cause a piece of text to flow like speech, without such sudden endings as periods. For those whose writings spring from internal monologues, this seems to be a blessing, a way to avoid molding thoughts into a comparatively non-fluid format. This is true, but it can backfire if overused.</p>

<p>For readers, long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. The reader must keep the grammar and meaning of the current sentence in an internal buffer until the very end, which -- for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it -- can be hard to do. Additionally, the em dash is a large glyph and its impact to the sentence structure is even larger. Its use is obvious even through squinting eyes, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page even before reading it.</p>

<h2>Hidden Complexities</h2>

<p>Within each usage pattern above are small issues.</p>

<h3>Spaces Overpower Hyphens</h3>

<p>When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like "ice cream break", its spaces visually overpower the hyphen: <code>pre-ice cream break</code> looks like <code>[pre-ice] cream break</code>, not <code>pre-[ice cream break]</code>.</p>

<p>One solution replaces the spaces with hyphens (<code>pre-ice-cream-break</code>), but this removes the ability to distinguish the original parts. Another removes the hyphens altogether (<code>pre ice cream break</code>), which has a similar problem but may be better for specific situations.</p>

<p>Those using LaTeX can replace the spaces with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space">thin spaces</a> (\LaTeX: <code>\thinspace</code>) to de-emphasize their separation:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">pre-ice\thinspace{}cream\thinspace{}break
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve found it best to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">before the ice cream break
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>It&#39;s crude, but for 90% of cases there&#39;s no loss of meaning.</p>

<h3>Line Breaks Interfering with Dashes</h3>

<p>If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It&#39;s accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being used to join two parts of a non-hyphenated word. En and em dashes are a little harder to parse.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge             v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">I am looking at dates about 20
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>30 days out.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I&#39;m looking at dates about 20<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">30 days out.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am pleased they thought that
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>however odd it may be.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I&#39;m pleased they thought that<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">however odd it may be.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>Generally it&#39;s recommended to either give them the same treatment as hyphens or to treat their left and right neighbors as one inseparable "word", as backwards as it may sound considering our treatment of hyphens.</p>

<h3>Justified Text Messes with Proportions</h3>

<p>Whatever dash one is using, when using justified text (where spaces are elongated to make both the left and right edges of a page straight vertical lines) elongated spaces can overpower dashes where non-elongated spaces would not have.</p>

<p>For example, see this simulation of left-aligned text:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge             v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">I said they were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">playdates don&#39;t last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>versus this simulation of justified text:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge             v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">I    said    they    were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">playdates don&#39;t last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>wherein "were-wolf" reads hyphenated because the spaces are proportionally larger than the em dash, making it appear as a hyphen.</p>

<p>One solution surrounds parenthetical em dashes with a space on either side, causing its total width to scale up at twice the rate of spaces:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge             v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">I   said   they  were  <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>  wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">playdates don&#39;t last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<h3>Input Difficulties</h3>

<p>Standard US keyboards support only the hyphen without more advanced knowledge, so many en and em dash users simply compose them from hyphens and spaces.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered En Dash</h4>

<p>The en dash looks similar enough to the hyphen in most fonts that people often settle for a single hyphen. \LaTeX requires two (<code>--</code>) for the en dash, however.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered Em Dash</h4>

<p>A common replacement for the em dash is a space on either end of two hyphens (<code>--</code>) or simply two hyphens (<code>--</code>). Because \LaTeX reserves two hyphens (<code>--</code>) for the en dash, it requires three (<code>---</code>) for the em.</p>

<h3>Output Difficulties</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, twos.dev renders in a monospace font for aesthetic reasons. But, the glyphs for these three dashes in monospace fonts are virtually---sometimes literally---indistinguishable. To make the differences visible on twos.dev, particularly this page, I use <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/main/cmd/transform/lengthen_dashes.go">some bespoke preprocessing</a> to substitute them out for their variable-width cousins.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love for there to be a "monospace with exceptions" font that takes this chore out of my hands.</p>

<h2>Debate</h2>

<p>Every usage rule above is in some level of turmoil [better word?] among writers, both within the rules and between them.</p>

<h2>Epilogue: Esoteric Dashes</h2>

<p>The <strong>swung dash</strong> (⁓) is an elongated tilde used to stand in for a word being defined in a dictionary.
