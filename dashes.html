				</label></p>

<p>I love pizza-liquor, but I've never had it New York style.</p>

<p>There are three common dashes in written English:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyphen : <span style="“font-family:sans-serif”">-</span></li>
<li>En dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span></li>
<li>Em dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The hyphen is used to join words, prefixes, and/or suffixes together, like father-in-law.</p>

<p>The en dash is used to create ranges, like 2020<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2030.</p>

<p>The em dash can be used as a more powerful parenthetical, a replacement for a colon, or to represent an interruption of a speaker.</p>

<h2>One Size Doesn't Fit All</h2>

<p>A myth states the em dash is so named because it is "one <code>M</code> wide", and the en dash "one <code>N</code> wide". This is... almost true. The confusing correction is that an em dash is so named because it is <code>1em</code> wide. Incidentally, the en is defined as half of one em; much of my focus will be on the em.</p>

<h3>The Em</h3>

<p>To talk about the em dash necessitates talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)" target="_blank">em</a>. The em (pronounced <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation" target="_blank">/ɛm/</a>) is a unit of length defined as the height of the character bounding box.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:boundingbox"><a href="#fn:boundingbox">1</a></sup> This height changes with font family and size, so the length of the em changes with it: <code>1em</code> is always one <em>font-heighth</em> long.</p>

<p>Specifying a font size in ems, then, is an exercise in ratios. The CSS declaration <code>font-size: 1em</code> is equivalent to <code>font-size: 100%</code>, while <code>1.5em</code> is equivalent to <code>150%</code> and so on; the current font size is used as a base to specify the desired font size.</p>

<p>The em's eccentric offering is that it can be used outside the context of font sizes. It can set margins, widths, even blur radii based on the font size of the containing context. It can scale an image up and down with the text around it, whether the text's changing size is a product of assistive technologies or simply of a component being reused in multiple contexts.</p>

<p>The em came about in the times of the printing press, when every <code>M</code> type was large and perfectly square, thus convenient to use as a proportional measurement for a given font and size. When the <code>M</code> type eventually rebelled against being square, the modern em shifted its definition to the remaining constant, the height. At the time this was effectively a non-change, but the updated definition allowed the <code>M</code> and the em to be decoupled.</p>

<h4>The Em Dash</h4>

<p>With the tailwind given by the definition of the em, the em dash is easily defined: a dash that is <code>1em</code> long. In a way, the em dash took up the mantle of the square <code>M</code> type. Because the em dash is <code>1em</code> long, and the em is defined as the height of the font, the em dash's bounding box is an exact square<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>in any font, at any size.</p>

<h4>The Root Em</h4>

<p>The <code>rem</code> or <strong>root em</strong> is a twist on the em. Where the em is defined using the current context's font size, the root em is defined using the root context's font size (in a web page, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>). This allows escape from relativity hell without reverting to absolutes:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="cl">html: 16pt              (default     = 16pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 2</span><span class="cl">  → body: 1.5em         (16pt * 1.5  = 24pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 3</span><span class="cl">    → .container: .75em (24pt *  .75 = 18pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 4</span><span class="cl">      → h1: 4em         (18pt * 4    = 72pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 5</span><span class="cl">      → p: 1em          (18pt * 1    = 18pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 6</span><span class="cl">    → footer: 0.5rem    (16pt * 0.5  =  8pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 7</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 8</span><span class="cl">key:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 9</span><span class="cl">context: requested size (calculation = final size)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">10</span><span class="cl">  → child element
</span></span></code></pre>

<h4>Aside: The Point</h4>

<p>It’s hard to define the em in terms of points without defining the point. The point has had a tumultuous and unstandardized history both physically and digitally, but today the world has predominantly settled on <code>1/72in</code> per point. This varies greatly among displays, devices, and assistive technologies; for example, a 21” 1440p display has more pixels per inch than a 27” 1440p display. To wrangle the variability, there exist new unstandardized concepts like <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskUseDP" target="_blank">density-independent pixels</a> on Android and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design#effective-pixels-and-scale-factor" target="_blank">effective pixels</a> on Windows. The tumultuous history, as it happens, hasn't ended.</p>

<p>Based on the displays I develop on, I’ve settled on a rough mental framework of “1px of em length per pt” because it’s close enough to true and easy to remember: a 16pt font has a 16px em and is therefore 16px high.</p>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<p>Advanced usage of dashes unfortunately revolves around avoiding common issues.</p>

<h3>Em Dash Overuse</h3>

<p>The em dash tends to be a trap to a new writer. It is sympathetic to stream-of-consciousness writing, wherein the writer is in "append-only" mode<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>thinking not of the structure of the sentence but of what new words may clarify it when tacked on. For people whose writings spring from internal monologues this seems a neat way to avoid adding structure to organic thoughts.</p>

<p>Organic thoughts have their place in writing, but it turns out spending time perfecting sentence structure pays dividends to the reader. Long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. Because the pre-dash thought may continue post-dash, the reader must keep its grammar and intention in an internal buffer, which<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>can be hard to do.</p>

<p>Separately, the em dash is a large glyph and hard to go unnoticed. Its use is obvious even in peripheral vision, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page before reading it.</p>

<h3>Belittled Hyphens</h3>

<p>When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like "frozen yogurt" its spaces can visually overpower the hyphen: <code>pre-frozen yogurt</code> looks like <code>[pre-frozen] yogurt</code>, not <code>pre-[frozen yogurt]</code>.</p>

<p>One solution replaces spaces with hyphens (<code>pre-frozen-yogurt</code>), which may or may not suit the hyphenation. The opposite (<code>pre frozen yogurt</code>) is another tool in the bag, but the best it can do is shift ambiguity, not remove it.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> users can replace each space with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space" target="_blank"><code>\thinspace</code></a> to de-emphasize them relative to hyphens, though the difference is subtle enough that you may also consider elongating nearby spaces:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt time
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">a<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>time
</span></span></code></pre>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{a pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt time}\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[\text{a\enspace{}pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt\enspace{}time}\]</span></p><p>Personally, the most common tool I reach for is to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a time before frozen yogurt
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>It's crude, but dependable.</p>

<h3>Broken Dashes</h3>

<p>If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It's accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being introduced to join a word split across lines. En and em dashes are a little harder to parse.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓ left page edge             ↓ right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am looking at dates about 20
</span></span></code></pre>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm looking at dates about 20</span></span></code></pre>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am pleased they thought that
</span></span></code></pre>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm pleased they thought that</span></span></code></pre>

<p>Strangely, the hyphen is the only dash that has an option here: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Non-breaking_hyphens" target="_blank">non-breaking hyphen</a> or "hard hyphen" is a hyphen glyph that sends a signal to the word wrapper that a wrap must not happen after it.</p>

<h3>Drowned Dashes</h3>

<p>When using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified" target="_blank">justified text</a> elongated spaces can overpower dashes where non-elongated spaces would not have.</p>

<p>For example, see this simulation of left-aligned text:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓ left page edge             ↓ right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I said they were</span></span></code></pre>

<p>And this simulation of justified text:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I    said    they   were</span></span></code></pre>

<p>In the justified simulation, "were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf" may read like the mythical creature "were-wolf" because the em dash looks short relative to the longer spaces.</p>

<p>A solution surrounds each parenthetical em dash with a space on either side, causing its total width to scale up at twice the rate of spaces:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I   said  they  were  </span></span></code></pre>

<h3>Input Difficulties</h3>

<p>Standard US keyboards support only the hyphen, so many en and em dash users simply compose them from hyphens and spaces.</p>

<p>No one should ever fault that, but for those who are willing to commit something new to memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>macOS

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>⌥ + -</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>⌥ + Shift + -</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>Alt + 0150</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>Alt + 0151</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For all others, read on.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered En Dash</h4>

<p>The en dash looks similar enough to the hyphen in most fonts that people often settle for a single hyphen: <code>2020-2030</code>. <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> requires two (<code>--</code>) for the en dash.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered Em Dash</h4>

<p>A common replacement for the em dash is a space on either end of two hyphens (<code>--</code>). Because <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> reserves two hyphens for the en dash, it requires three (<code>---</code>) for the em.</p>

<h3>Output Difficulties</h3>

<p>When rendering monospaced fonts, the glyphs for many dashes are virtually
indistinguishable from each other. To make the differences visible, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/a61379f9c0f121e9e98033c2a32c3ef47f975f48/winter/document.go#L41-L47" target="_blank">a bespoke
preprocessing
step</a>
to render twos.dev's dashes in a variable width font, even when among monospaced
characters.</p>

<p>I'd love for there to be a "monospace with exceptions" font that takes this chore out of my hands.</p>

<h2>Bonus Round: Esoteric Dashes</h2>

<p>The hyphen, en dash, and em dash get all the love, but behind the scenes are a silent majority of dashes that don't often get to see the light of day.</p>

<p>The <strong>swung dash</strong> (<span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>) is an elongated tilde used to stand in for a word being defined in a dictionary.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:swung"><a href="#fn:swung">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>boot (n)</p>

<p>ex: Let me put on my other <span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>horizontal bar</strong> is a way to introduce quotations. Confusingly, its length is almost always identical to the em dash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">―</span> O Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!</p>

<p><em>James Joyce's Ulysses p. 335</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>hyphen bullet</strong> is a hyphen to be used in place of a bullet point.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">- This is a hyphen
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>The <strong>figure dash</strong> is a variant of the en dash having the same width as digits (which are uniformly wide in most fonts). It is meant for phone numbers and other numeric contexts where columnar alignment is required or pleasing.</p>

<pre><span style="font-family:serif"><span style="font-family:monospace">Figure dash: </span><span style="font-size:2em">867‒5309</span> ← same as below
<span style="font-family:monospace">Number:      </span><span style="font-size:2em">86705309</span> ← same as above
<span style="font-family:monospace">En dash:     </span><span style="font-size:2em">867<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>5309</span> ← longer
<span style="font-family:monospace">Hyphen:      </span><span style="font-size:2em">867-5309</span> ← shorter
</span></pre>

<p>Lastly, my favorite: the <strong>soft hyphen</strong> is a zero-width, <strong>invisible</strong> character that (opposite to the hard hyphen) denotes a place the word wrapper is <em>welcome</em> to wrap. This can be used in the middle of a compound word or long line of inert code to provide a cleaner wrap.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge            v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                           |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">No soft hyphen:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilisticexpialid-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">5</span><span class="cl">ocious
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">6</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">7</span><span class="cl">Soft hyphen after 'istic':
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">8</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilistic-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">9</span><span class="cl">expialidocious
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>You can see the soft hyphen in action when viewing the article titles of <a href="async.html">Why Be
Synchronous?</a> and <a href="autism.html">Anonymously Autistic</a> on a small screen,
where their respective long words would otherwise break the right margin.
With soft hyphens we can ensure the word splits when needed, as well as be in control
of where it splits so it doesn't happen mid-syllable.</p>
