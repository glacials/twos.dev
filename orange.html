<h1>Orange is my favorite color</h1>

<p>So here was my day:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>12:00a</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> The Orange Box is released. I am asleep, but have already paid
for and preloaded it.</li>
<li><strong>4:00a</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> I wake up inadvertently from excitement! I shower and get all my
get-readying for school over with.</li>
<li><strong>4:25a</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> I start playing Portal.</li>
<li><strong>5:30a</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> The four alarms I set in fifteen minute increments start. I had
planned to wake now, but I’m already up (and thinking with portals). Alarms
get turned off.</li>
<li><strong>7:00a</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> I beat Portal! I check out some of the bonus levels I unlocked, as
well as skim over the achievements section. Man, there’re still a lot of
things I can do!</li>
<li><strong>7:10a</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> I start playing Half-Life 2: Episode Two.</li>
<li><strong>8:00a</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> School. I have fun watching my friends’ faces when I tell them
that I woke up at 4am to play Portal <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> and that I beat it before school. I
love emotion! I also casually inform anyone who would eventually play Portal
that the cake is a lie <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> including my physics desk. I am also the least tired
I remember being for quite a while throughout the day <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> an odd occurrence,
considering my operating hours for this day.</li>
<li><strong>3:30p</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> I nervously show some family members how Portal works. I want to
play Episode Two! That’s what I get for showing them the trailer.</li>
<li><strong>4:00p</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> Back to HL2:E2.</li>
<li><strong>8:30p</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> Episode Two: beaten.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was pretty much my favorite day in quite a while. The following are rants
about the awesomeness about the games involved in it.</p>

<p><strong>Portal</strong> is <em>awesome</em>. Let me say that I’m not totally new to this concept <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>
I’ve very repeatedly played with similar systems in Prey (with the custom
portal-creation mod) and Narbacular Drop (the game from which <em>Portal</em> evolved,
created by a group of students from Digipen who now all happily work for Valve),
but Portal combines the slickness and meaning of the former with the
portal-focused gameplay from the latter to make an <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I simply must repeat myself
<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> awesome game.</p>

<p>I’ve said before that I’m a huge storyline guy, and although no trailers do this
one justice, the intricacy of it is really something to take into consideration;
it’s much deeper than you’d imagine, even after playing completely through it.
At first you’re just like, “Oh, so I’m this test participant for this awesome
portal stuff, that’s cool”, but it gets so much more intricate <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> to an amount
that I actually do not know at this time, but is sure to be hinted at upon the
arrival of Episode Three (yep, you guessed it <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> <em>Portal</em> takes place in the
Half-Life universe, and this is actually apparent during play of Episode Two; a
matter which surely will be delved into further along in the episodes).</p>

<p>As for <strong>Episode Two</strong>: JEEZ VALVE, FINALLY!</p>

<p>Now that that’s out of my system, I can say that it’s actually a pretty good
game. You can really tell how much work they put into the engine <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> maybe not
through huge, blatantly noticeable things, but small things, like how when
you’re in a cave the light reflections look much, well, shinier, and how (I love
this) when you spin to face another direction really fast, your screen actually
<em>blurs</em> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it sounds trivial, but it’s a pretty awesome thing when you notice it
for the first time (if you came into my room when I noticed it, you’d just watch
me spinning around in circles really fast for about two minutes straight).</p>

<p>There isn’t a <em>whole</em> lot of new stuff in it (a new car and a new type of mine
come to mind), but the storyline actually starts to connect more with that of
Half-Life 1 (notice I only said starts to <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> there are just a few things
mentioned about some memories from the original Half-Life that could have to do
with your future success), as well as <em>Portal</em>, as I mentioned already.</p>

<p>I hate to leave <em>Team Fortress 2</em> out of the party, but I’d already played it in
beta, so I’m not as super-excited about it right now. Make no mistake, though:
The Orange Box is a purchase <em>well</em> worth the money if you’re any sort of fan at
all of Half-Life or its relatives. Come to think of it, I think most people
would enjoy <em>Portal</em> despite their gaming background.</p>
