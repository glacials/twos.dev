<p>Summer and I recently stayed a few weeks with her parents in Harbin, China.
They don’t see many westerners.</p>

<p>It gets damn cold.</p>

<p><a href="/img/china-harbin.png">
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A satellite map zoomed out to see most of china. Harbin is circled in the far northeast." src="/img/china-harbin.png" title=""/>
				</label></a></p>

<p>Harbin is near the northern border, far beyond the popular cities.</p>

<p>A few things surprised me about the culture there.
What follows is a list of my miniature culture shocks.</p>

<h2>Natural Refrigeration</h2>

<p>Kitchens this far north use their pantries as natural refrigerators, with the framing of the building set to expose 2<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>3 pantry walls to the exterior.</p>

<p>Many residences do not have powered refrigerators.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of the outside of an apartment building, having a vertical slice jutting out with three walls of windows on it." src="/img/china-pantries1.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label>

				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building." src="/img/china-pantries3.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label>

				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building." src="/img/china-pantries4.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label>

				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building." src="/img/china-pantries6.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>More exposed surface area means more and faster cooling.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a wire rack with vegetables laying on it, like cabbage and green onions." src="/img/china-pantry.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>The pantry can be used to both cool and dry food.</p>

<p>Summer shared an anecdote that in the winter, when a restaurant asks if you want a beer from the fridge or the pantry,
the fridge ones are <em>warmer</em>.</p>

<h2>Water</h2>

<p>Tap water in China is not potable.
Filters are around but after generations of boiling water, everyone just likes hot water more than cold.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it makes total sense evolutionarily why some cultures would benefit from cold water and some from hot.</p>

<h2>Smoking</h2>

<p>Smoking in restaurants is technically banned, but everyone does it because there's no enforcement. And there's no incentive to enforce it because tobacco is nationalized and comprises 7% of government revenue.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:https-www-theexa"><a href="#fn:https-www-theexa">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>Purchasing Unfinished Homes</h2>

<p>Homes in China<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>most families live in condominiums<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>are built and purchased unfinished, the same way an American home may come with an unfinished basement.</p>

<p>(TODO: Photo)</p>

<p>The buyer then picks fixtures and finishes and pays for them separately.</p>

<h2>Identical Buildings</h2>

<p>It's common to see groups of nearby buildings sharing a single design. You see this once in a while for two or three buildings in the US, but it's far more common in China, and each design is implemented instead by four, five, six, or more buildings. Combined with my point on unfinished condos above, I get the sense China treats construction as something best done with economies of scale, as a rule.</p>

<p>(TODO: Photos)</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>The food was by far the best part of China,
though I've had a few years to acclimate my taste due to the popularity of authentic Chinese food in Seattle and Vancouver.</p>

<p>Some notable items I tried:</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a clear bottle of gold-colored fizzy liquid, with a label depicting a loaf of bread." src="/img/china-breadsoda.jpg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Bread soda. Watch out for bloating.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a small disposable bowl of wide noodles with veggies mixed in. In the background is a night market." src="/img/china-kaolengmian.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>烤冷面 kǎolěngmiàn ("grilled cold noodles"), my years-long favorite Chinese food.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of me, a white man, dipping a long donut-looking item in a cup of soy milk. We are sitting at a table on the street and the sun is rising." src="/img/china-youtiao.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Plain donuts (油条 yóutiáo) dipped in soy milk (豆浆 dòujiāng), a common if unhealthy breakfast.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of seemingly normal cheese pizza." src="/img/china-pizza.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Pizza Hut is considered a slight delicacy in China, like sushi is in the US.
It looks the same, but Chinese pizza is anything but<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>this pizza uses cream cheese.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of an egg tart in KFC packaging." src="/img/china-kfc.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>KFC sells egg tarts and a few other Chinese items.
Neither of us enjoyed them, but it's interesting to see local menus for international chains.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of yumi lao, which looks like like (and is) a sugary mass of fried corn." src="/img/china-yumilao.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Fried corn fritters (玉米烙 yùmǐ lào) taste like a cross between popcorn, kettle corn, and corn.
If you like those flavors individually, you'll love these.</p>

<h2>Internet QR payments with audio announcements</h2>

<p>Pay-by-phone is universally accepted and expected in businesses, but there’s no tap-to-pay.</p>

<p>Instead, business have QR codes posted that point to WeChat accounts.
The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet like you would to a Venmo account.</p>

<p>A nearby store speaker announces the incoming payment and amount automatically,
signaling to the shopkeeper that you have paid.
For small corner shops, I never saw any sort of scanner in use.</p>

<h2>City Limits</h2>

<p>Harbin's population is 5M, which sounds dense.
But geographically, China's cities tend to be more like US counties or metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="The city limits of New York, NY, USA overlaid on the city limits of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. New York City's city limits are tiny in comparison, only about 2% of the size." src="/img/china-ny.png" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>New York City (solid red) is ~2% the area of Harbin (dotted red).</p>

<p>For reference, some densities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Harbin, China: ~100 people / km<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5M-people-in-53"><a href="#fn:5M-people-in-53">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Seattle, WA: ~2k people / km<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:737k-people-in-3"><a href="#fn:737k-people-in-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Greater Seattle Area<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:https-en-wikiped"><a href="#fn:https-en-wikiped">4</a></sup>: ~250 people / km<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4M-people-in-15k"><a href="#fn:4M-people-in-15k">5</a></sup></li>
<li>New York, NY: ~6500 people / km<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:8M-people-in-121"><a href="#fn:8M-people-in-121">6</a></sup></li>
<li>New York Metropolitan Area<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:https-en-wikiped"><a href="#fn:https-en-wikiped">7</a></sup>: ~2100 people / km<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:19M-people-in-89"><a href="#fn:19M-people-in-89">8</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2>Westerners in Social Media</h2>

<p>After two weeks in Harbin,
a city with a small international airport,
I saw only one obviously non-Chinese person.
In Daqing, children in the street stopped playing to stare at me.
Adults at nearby tables in restaurants struck up conversation or stared.</p>

<p>Summer’s family had never met an American,
but they had been exposed to extreme tropes and stereotypes on social media,
mostly focused on the political right.
They were surprised by my kindness, politeness, and sunny disposition.</p>

<h2>Megaphones</h2>

<p>China advertising is noisy.
It's common to hear indecipherable megaphones in the distance that give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObELK2bGCS8">City 17</a> vibes,
until you realize they're just advertising fruit or noodles on repeat.</p>

<h2>Sewage Smell</h2>

<p>It's not omnipresent, but every few dozen breaths carry a sewage smell. Chinese plumbing doesn't leverage traps like we do, which are plumbing tricks that prevent smells from traveling backwards up sewer liens.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A sketch of two types of traps, which look like capital 'N' shapes where the water comes in the top-right of the 'N' and leaves the bottom-left of it, leaving the middle section always full with a buffer of water, preventing air from traveling from the bottom-left to the top-right." src="/img/china-trap.png" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>A trap is a plumbing trick that makes a pipe airtight but not watertight. (Image: public domain via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vattenlaas.png">Nordisk Familjebok, 1921</a>)</p>

<p>Traps are all over the place in western plumbing.
You can retrofit a trapless system with an aftermarket component,
but the one we tried drained prohibitively slowly,
so was effectively a plug.
Better than nothing, but not worth the money.</p>
