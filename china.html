<p>Summer and I recently stayed a few weeks with her parents in Harbin, China.</p>

<p><a href="/img/china-harbin.png">
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A satellite map zoomed out to see most of china. Harbin is circled in the far northeast." src="/img/china-harbin.png" title=""/>
				</label></a></p>

<p>Harbin is near the northern border, far beyond the popular cities.</p>

<p>A few things caught me off guard about the culture.</p>

<h2>Natural Refrigeration</h2>

<p>Kitchens this far north use their pantries as natural refrigerators, with the framing of the building set to expose 2<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>3 pantry walls to the exterior.</p>

<p>Many residences do not have powered refrigerators.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of the outside of an apartment building, having a vertical slice jutting out with three walls of windows on it." src="/img/china-pantries1.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label>

				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building." src="/img/china-pantries3.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label>

				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building." src="/img/china-pantries4.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label>

				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building." src="/img/china-pantries6.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>More exposed surface area means more and faster cooling.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a wire rack with vegetables laying on it, like cabbage and green onions." src="/img/china-pantry.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>The pantry can be used to both cool and dry food.</p>

<p>Summer shared a half-joke that in the winter,
if you want your restaurant beer served less cold,
you ask for a refrigerated one.
They're warmer than then pantry-stored ones.</p>

<h2>Hot Water</h2>

<p>People in China drink their water hot, not cold.
The tap water is not potable, so you have to sterilize it by boiling it.
After generations of this,
I guess people just preferred their water hot even as filtering became usable.</p>

<p>It is even embedded in traditional Chinese medicine that you must drink hot water to restore your body's <em>yang</em>.
After emigrating, Summer would get stomacheaches from drinking cold water on an empty stomach.
Whether it was physiological or psychosomatic,
it is clear a lifetime of drinking one temperature of water can have an effect on a person,
so I don't exactly blame anyone for the preference or belief.</p>

<p>There was some effort in convincing her family I wasn't injuring myself by ordering and drinking cold water instead.</p>

<h2>Smoking</h2>

<p>Smoking is huge in China.
It consumes about half of all cigarattes.</p>

<p>Smoking in restaurants is technically banned, but everyone does it because there's no enforcement.
There's no incentive to enforce it because tobacco is nationalized, bringing in ~7% of all government revenue.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:https-www-theexa"><a href="#fn:https-www-theexa">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>The food was by far the best part of China,
though I've had a few years to acclimate my taste in Seattle and Vancouver.</p>

<p>Some notable items I tried:</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a clear bottle of gold-colored fizzy liquid, with a label depicting a loaf of bread." src="/img/china-breadsoda.jpg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Bread soda. Watch out for bloating.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a small disposable bowl of wide noodles with veggies mixed in. In the background is a night market." src="/img/china-kaolengmian.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>烤冷面 kǎolěngmiàn ("grilled cold noodles"), my years-long favorite Chinese food.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of me, a white man, dipping a long donut-looking item in a cup of soy milk. We are sitting at a table on the street and the sun is rising." src="/img/china-youtiao.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Plain donuts (油条 yóutiáo) dipped in soy milk (豆浆 dòujiāng), a common if unhealthy breakfast.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of seemingly normal cheese pizza." src="/img/china-pizza.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Pizza Hut is a pseudodelicacy in China, similar to sushi in the US.
It looks the same, but this pizza uses cream cheese and has a sweet, oily crust.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of an egg tart in KFC packaging." src="/img/china-kfc.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>KFC sells egg tarts and a few other Chinese items.
Neither of us enjoyed them, but it was interesting exploring international chains' local menus.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of yumi lao, which looks like like (and is) a sugary mass of fried corn." src="/img/china-yumilao.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Fried corn fritters (玉米烙 yùmǐlào) taste like a sugary cross between popcorn, kettle corn, and corn.
If you like those flavors, you'll love these.</p>

<h2>QR Payments</h2>

<p>Pay-by-phone is universally accepted and expected in businesses, but there’s no tap-to-pay.</p>

<p>Instead, small businesses have QR codes posted on their walls that point to WeChat accounts.
The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet, like a Venmo payment.</p>

<p>A nearby store speaker announces incoming payment amounts automatically,
signaling to the shopkeeper that you have paid.</p>

<h2>City Limits</h2>

<p>Harbin's population is 5M, which sounds dense.
But geographically, China's cities tend to be more like US counties or metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="The city limits of New York, NY, USA overlaid on the city limits of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. New York City's city limits are tiny in comparison, only about 2% of the size." src="/img/china-ny.png" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>New York City (solid red) is ~2% the area of Harbin (dotted red).</p>

<p>For example, take Beijing:</p>

<p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/charts.min.css"/>

</ul>
</div><p></p>

<p>Beijing more resembles Greater New York<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a conglomeration of over 70 cities<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>than it does New York City.
The same pattern holds for Harbin at a smaller scale.</p>

<p>This conclusion took some effort to reach, as I had only ever heard that Harbin was a "small town" and that it had 5M people,
an initially astonishing pair of facts I attributed to China simply having an order of magnitude more people than the US.</p>

<h2>Westerners in Social Media</h2>

<p>I'm very white.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A photo of me and Summer dressed up at a nice dinner. I am white. Summer is Chinese. We are both laughing and I am showing the 'sign of the horns'." src="/img/china-white.jpg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Me and Summer.</p>

<p>After two weeks in Harbin,
which has an international airport (albeit small),
I saw only one obviously non-Chinese person.
In Daqing, two hours away by car,
children in the street stopped playing to stare at me.
Adults at nearby tables in restaurants struck up conversations or stared.</p>

<p>Summer’s family had never met an American,
but they had been exposed to extreme tropes and stereotypes on social media,
mostly<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>though they didn't know it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>about the extreme political right.
They were surprised by my kindness, politeness, and sunny disposition.</p>

<h2>Sewage</h2>

<p>It's not omnipresent, but every few dozen breaths carry a sewage smell.
Chinese plumbing tends not to use traps, which are plumbing tricks that prevent smells from traveling backwards up sewer liens.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
				  <img alt="A sketch of two types of traps, which look like capital 'N' shapes where the water comes in the top-right of the 'N' and leaves the bottom-left of it, leaving the middle section always full with a buffer of water, preventing air from traveling from the bottom-left to the top-right." src="/img/china-trap.png" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Traps make pipes airtight but not watertight. (Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vattenlaas.png">Nordisk Familjebok, 1921</a>)</p>

<p>Traps are all over the place in western plumbing.
You can retrofit a trapless Chinese system with an aftermarket component,
but the one we tried drained prohibitively slowly,
so was effectively a plug.</p>
