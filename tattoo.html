  <h1>Tattoos as Moral Contracts</h1>

  <p>December 2021</p>

  <p>
    This year, I got a tattoo. My morals had been at odds with my behaviors in a place
    very important to me—the climate crisis. It’s easy to think about how horrible the
    climate crisis is, and yes definitely someone should do something about it, yes
    probably those big corporations that sounds nice, now let’s forget about it for
    another year.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn’t a great way to get things done and I had the cognizance to recognize
    that, but it kept happening to me. So I tattooed a reminder on my forearm.

    After six months with this puppy, it’s done more than I thought it could.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, it’s a constant reminder. It’s not a checklist item I can mark off or that
    can fall to the bottom of my list. It can’t be forgotten about or left behind in an
    app change. It will be there as long as I will be, which is exactly how long I want
    to be conscious of the climate crisis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, it’s a social forcing function to act within my morals. When people ask me
    about my tattoo, I know I need to “have my story straight”. I need to know
    everything about myself that’s not better than climate par and have a roadmap for
    fixing it ready. No one expects me to be Captain Planet, but if I have a methane
    stove and don’t at least have a plan for going induction, well, that’s an
    embarrassing moment for someone with a climate crisis tattoo.
  </p>
  <p>
    In just six months these two pressures together have motivated me into research,
    action, and activism on how to make my kids and grandkids not spite me. I’m better
    informed about policy, I'm involved in local Seattle politics (actively pushing for
    more walk-friendly neighborhoods), and our house is running on 100% green energy.

    If you have a lifelong motivation, a few hundred dollars, and a decent tolerance for
    pain, I recommend getting an aspirational tattoo.
