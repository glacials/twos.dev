  <h2>Job history</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>FalconX (January 2022 - present)
      <ul>
        <li>Staff Software Engineer</li>
        <li>Came on from an acquihire of YourBase.</li>
        <li>
          I was #72 at FalconX. As the company was taking off I founded the developer
          productivity team, building and improving internal tooling using experience
          from Twitch (which had grown similarly) and YourBase (which taught me the
          leverage of devtools). Specific goals were to reduce onboarding time (hire →
          first meaningful PR) and shorten the release cycle (PR merged → code in
          production) as the company quickly grew its engineering team.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>YourBase (2020 - January 2022)
      <ul>
        <li>Staff Software Engineer</li>
        <li>
          I was #5 at YourBase. I built our
          <a href="https://vimeo.com/530517699" title="I also wrote and recorded this video :D">Python test acceleration</a>,
          which traces tests to build test dependency graphs. On subsequent runs, the
          graphs are used to skip tests whose tested code hasn't changed. The result was
          a 50-90% reduction in test times. I worked directly with our customers
          including Yelp, Venmo, and more.
        </li>
        <li>YourBase was then acquihired by FalconX.</li>
