# twos.dev
`twos.dev` (pronounced "tooz dot dev" or "two esses dot dev" if you like) is my portfolio, whose name is a joke based on
how I have to describe my last name to people. This website is basically an extended version of my resume.

The site is written in Vue single-file components, for no other reason than that's what I was learning last time I
rewrote it.
