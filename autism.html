      <i>"Autism is a Spectrum" Doesn't Mean What You Think</i></a>.
  </i>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical.
  I have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and
  fighting climate change. I don't need support from others on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
  And yet my psychologist, with 30 years of experience and a Ph.D. in clinical
  psychology, wrote it right there on my medical chart:
</p>
<blockquote>Autism spectrum disorder</blockquote>
<p>
  This is because behind the scenes, there's a "me" hardly anyone sees. It's the
  me who can be paralyzed by a
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29690399" target="_blank">text</a>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/1273051092960440320" target="_blank">message</a>, whose day is ruined if teeth-brushing and showering happen out of order,
  and who spends ~an hour a day performing internal conversation planning and
  retrospectives. It's the me who was mute for nine years.
</p>

<p>
  It's also the me who was taught that all these qualities are just character
  flaws that can be willed away.
</p>
<p>
  You'd never notice that me, because I hide him well. Of the folks with autism,
  I'm not an outlier in doing that. In fact, 2% of all human beings have autism
  [1]. Statistically, you've certainly met several of them without realizing it.
  Why is that, and what is it like to live that life?
</p>
<a name="spectrum">
  <h2>The Infamous Spectrum</h2>
</a>
<p>
  We've all heard "autism is a spectrum". But that word, "spectrum", in that
  context, has had its meaning lost to time. Often people think of folks with
  autism as "high functioning" or "low functioning", as if these are positions
  on the spectrum. But a spectrum is not a scale. This is how to actually think
  about the autism spectrum:
</p>
<p>
  </p><center>
    <div class="spectrum"> </div>
  </center>
<p></p>
<p>
  There is no "more" or "less"; no "high" or "low". There is only "different".
  And yet people often still feel they
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it" target="_blank">know it when they see it</a>; that people with autism either act like Rain Man or don't, and that those
  are the two (if even that many) types of autism.
</p>
<p>
  What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a
  glance?
</p>
<a name="canary1">
  <h2>The Canary Symptom</h2>
</a>
<p>
  Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same
  hand. Of the many, the DSM-5 calls out a few examples:
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">
  <p>
    Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships,
    ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various
    social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making
    friends; to absence of interest in peers.
  </p>
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html" target="_blank">DSM-5</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Pay special attention to that first example, which I'll paraphrase as
  "inability to change behavior based on social feedback". We'll come back to
  that later.
</p>
<a name="example">
  <h3>A Personal Example</h3>
</a>
<p>
  One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As
  cool as it sounds, this is no superpower. My body's defense systems will
  sometimes malfunction and miscalibrate incoming volume.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you're in a coffee shop reading a book when someone walks up to you,
  takes out an air horn, points it in your ear and briefly squeezes the trigger.
  What would your brain and body do instinctively? Would it startle, flinch,
  recoil? What if the person didn't go away, and kept squeezing the trigger
  randomly every few seconds? What if you looked around and slowly realized in
  horror that everyone else had their own air horn and they have all started
  doing the same?
</p>
<p>
  Your instinctive responses escalate to stress, panic, confusion. You keep
  trying to read your book but the air horns keep sounding and your body keeps
  flinching. You can't concentrate; your eyes are moving over the words in your
  book but you're not understanding them. You start getting annoyed at all the
  people wielding air horns<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span><i>could they just not?! I'm trying to read!</i>
</p>
<p>
  This is a hearing hypersensitivity. At random times, my brain will think every
  little sound is as loud as an air horn and it will execute all these
  physiological responses involuntarily. Even when I know it's a
  malfunction<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>which took me 30 years to learn<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it's still just as hard as ever to
  get through a paragraph in that book, to not flinch, to not become stressed,
  to not panic. Even when I can rationally tell myself in the moment
  <i>It's all in your head</i>, it doesn't stop the involuntary response.
</p>
<p>
  You may understand then why I and many other people with autism would, as
  children, collapse to the floor in public, cover their ears, and scream.
</p>
<a name="canary2">
  <h3>Killing the Canary</h3>
</a>
<p>
  In many ways, I'm one of the lucky ones. I didn't get dealt that "inability to
  change behavior based on social feedback" symptom, above. So when as a child I
  collapsed to the floor and screamed, and other people looked at me like I was
  losing it (reminder: I was) I can log that detail away, and work a little more
  towards avoiding it next time. I've iterated on this quite a bit over 30
  years:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the floor screaming</li>
  <li>Ears covered, eyes shut, silent</li>
  <li>On the floor cross-legged, teeth gritted, trying to dissociate</li>
  <li>Fingers-in-ears, screaming interally</li>
  <li>Inventing excuses to stay home</li>
  <li>Going home</li>
</ol>
<p>
  My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same.
  During a hearing hypersensitivity, inside I'm still that kid rolling on the
  floor screaming. The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.
</p>
<a name="canary3">
  <h3>When the Canary Lives</h3>
</a>
<p>
  People dealt the "inability to change behavior based on social feedback" card
  get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what
  the world thinks autism "looks like"; the canary symptom that reveals the
  rest.
</p>
<p>
  The people with this symptom, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking
  it, often need more support because our world is not built to accomodate them
  or understand them well. But they are not any more "low-functioning" than I am
  "high-functioning". Those words are descriptions of how <em>observers</em>
  experience autism, not how autism-havers do. That's why those terms have
  fallen out of use since the DSM-5.
</p>
<a name="masking">
  <h2>Masking</h2>
</a>
<p>
  This ability to fake not having autism is called <b>masking</b>. Those of us
  who can mask<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>those without the canary symptom<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>mask in virtually every social
  situation.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a temporary "get to know me and I'll stop masking" deal; I mask in
  front of my mom, and Summer, and even my psychologist. It's like an emulation
  layer that sits on top of my brain so I can run programs that let me
  communicate with others, programs like "talking" and "facial expressions" and
  "not losing it".
</p>
<p>
  It's not that I feel forced to do these things. I am a human being, so I crave
  social interaction. I love my friends and family and I enjoy interacting with
  them, and this is how I have to do it. I just wish we ran the same
  architecture, because masking is
  <em>exhausting</em> [2]. My brain overclocks itself just running this
  emulation layer. It reallocates important resources from other programs like
  reason and problem-solving. I literally become dumber when I am with others.
</p>
<p>
  For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every
  day is "unmasking", which I'd equate to the feeling of getting home from a
  long trip and flopping down on your own bed. Masking is a great tool and being
  able to use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" target="_blank">extra toll</a>.
</p>
<a name="radar">
  <h3>Flying Under the Radar</h3>
</a>
<p>
  One risk of masking is going your whole life undiagnosed. You don't have to
  know you're masking to mask. Historically most autism diagnoses are in
  children, which is no coincidence<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>if you happen to slip past childhood without
  a diagnosis, chances are good that you're old enough to have learned masking,
  which can hide your autism forever. I narrowly avoided this fate. I missed
  diagnosis during my childhood window and it was 30 years until my eventual
  adult diagnosis, which happened more by chance than anything.
</p>
<p>
  It sounds silly in retrospect to spend so much effort masking and dealing with
  other issues without realizing that other people don't, but it's difficult to
  identify atypicality when you've only ever piloted one brain.
</p>
<a name="selfcheck">
  <h3>The Rough Self-Check</h3>
</a>
<p>
  Medical help is the best way to find answers. But in the real world not
  everybody has access to it due to things like family, income, benefits, or
  location. It's therefore common to find people in the autism community who
  identify as self-diagnosed; they are pretty sure they have some form of autism
  based on how well others' stories resonate with them, but they're either
  unwilling or unable to confirm that with a medical professional.
</p>
<p>
  Even for those who are willing and able, going from ignorance to "Oh! That
  happens to me too!" is often the kick-start needed to seek professional
  attention. Therefore I present for your benefit a small list of
  non-professional, non-medical autism indicators that may warrant, at minimum,
  further investigation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Occasional or constant annoyance at typically unannoying things like touch,
    light, or sound (sensory hypersensitivies)
  </li>
  <li>
    More than your peers, a need to dig into what people say by asking
    clarifying questions (difficulty dealing with ambiguity)
  </li>
  <li>Eliminating all facial expression when exiting a room (masking)</li>
  <li>More confusion about social conventions than your peers</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If these resonate with you, consider it a starting point to slingshot yourself
  into more research and, if available to you, seek a professional.
</p>
<a name="conclusion">
  <h2>More People than You Think</h2>
</a>
<p>
  Two percent of people have autism. There is no "high-functioning" or
  "low-functioning" autism, because autism is a deck of cards full of symptoms,
  and each hand is different. One possible symptom is a canary that reveals the
  others, but not everybody has this symptom. For those who don't, there is a
  different set of challenges, often had in private and unfortunately, often
  taken to the grave.
</p>
<p>
  Be open about your own brain: what does it do well? What does it do poorly?
  Like sharing salary information, we can't know what our situation is until we
  normalize talking about it.
</p>
<p>
  Because really, truly, the best part of my autism journey was just finding
  out.
