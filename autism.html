      <i>"Autism is a Spectrum" Doesn't Mean What You Think</i></a>.
    </i>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical. I
    have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and
    fighting climate change. I don't need support from others on a daily basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet my psychologist, with 30 years of experience and a Ph.D. in clinical
    psychology, wrote it right there on my medical chart:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Autism spectrum disorder
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This is because behind the scenes, there's a "me" hardly anyone sees. It's the me
    who can be paralyzed by a
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29690399">text</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/1273051092960440320">message</a>, whose
    day is ruined if teeth-brushing and showering happen out of order, and who spends
    ~an hour a day performing internal conversation planning and retrospectives. It's
    the me who was mute for nine years.
  <p>
    It's also the me who was taught that all these qualities are just character flaws
    that can be willed away.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'd never notice that me, because I hide him well. And of the folks with autism,
    I'm not an outlier in doing that. In fact, 2% of all human beings have autism [1].
    Statistically, you've certainly met several of them without realizing it. Does that
    surprise you?
  </p>
  <h2>The Infamous Spectrum</h2>
  <p>
    We've all heard "autism is a spectrum". But that word, "spectrum", in that context,
    has had its meaning lost to time. Often people think of folks with autism  as
    "high functioning" or "low functioning", as if these are positions on the spectrum.
    But a spectrum is not a scale. This is how to actually think about the autism
    spectrum:
  </p>
  <p><center><div class="spectrum">&nbsp;</div></center></p>
  <p>
    There is no "more" or "less"; no "high" or "low". There is only "different". And
    yet people often still feel they
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">know it when they
    see it</a>; that people with autism either act like Rain Man or don't, and that
    those are the two (if even that many) types of autism.
  </p>
  <p>
    What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a glance?
  </p>
  <h2>The Canary Symptom</h2>
  <p>
    Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same hand. Of
    the many, the DSM-5 calls out a few examples:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">
    <p>
      Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships, ranging,
      for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts;
      to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of
      interest in peers.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">DSM-5</a>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Pay special attention to that first example, which I'll paraphrase as "inability to
    change behavior based on social feedback". We'll come back to that later.
  </p>
  <h3>A Personal Example</h3>
  <p>
    One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As cool as
    it sounds, this is no superpower. My body's defense systems will sometimes
    malfunction and incorrectly believe things are too loud.
  </p>
  <p>
    During one of these bouts, all the neurological safety mechanisms of an air horn
    being blown point-blank down the ear canal activate in response to innocuous sounds,
    like a person speaking or a computer mouse clicking. The brain goes through all the
    expected point-blank-air-horn feelings: startle, flinching, stress, panic. The
    intensity of these feelings prevent any real thought from coming into being as the
    metaphorical air horns shove their way through the grey matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, the all-around feeling of <em>losing it</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine going to a normal place like a grocery store, except on this particular trip
    to the grocery store dozens of people are point-blank blowing air horns into your
    ears, of random pitches and randomly starting and stopping. Maybe you'll understand
    me, then, when I say that as a kid I would sometimes collapse to the grocery store
    floor and roll around screaming with my hands against my ears, begging to go home.
  </p>
  <h3>Killing the Canary</h3>
  <p>
    In many ways, I'm one of the lucky ones. I didn't get dealt the "inability to change
    behavior based on social feedback" symptom. So when other people in the grocery
    store look at me like I'm losing it (reminder: I am) I can log that detail away, and
    work a little more towards silencing that canary next time. I've gone through
    several stages over 30+ years:
    <ol>
      <li>Rolling on the floor screaming</li>
      <li>Covering my ears with my palms and strongly shutting my eyes</li>
      <li>Sitting down in the aisle gritting my teeth and trying to tune everything out</li>
      <li>Subtly putting my fingers in my ears and screaming interally</li>
      <li>Preventatively inventing excuses to stay home</li>
      <li>(all grown up) Leaving</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same. During a
    hearing hypersensitivity, inside I'm still that kid rolling on the floor screaming.
    The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.
  </p>
  <h3>Letting the Canary Live</h3>
  <p>
    People dealt the "inability to change behavior based on social feedback" card get
    stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what the world
    thinks autism "looks like".
  </p>
  <p>
    These people, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking it, often need more
    support because our world is not built to accomodate them or understand them well.
    But they are not any more "low-functioning" than I am "high-functioning". Those
    words are descriptions of how <em>observers</em> experience autism, not how
    autism-havers do. That's why these terms have fallen out of use since the DSM-5.
  </p>
  <h2>Masking</h2>
  <p>
    This ability to fake not having autism is called <b>masking</b>. Those of us who
    can, do it ~every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Masking a hearing hypersensitivity is just one example. Autism can come with several
    sensory hypersensitivities, and a full deck of other symptoms. For many of them, you
    can find great masking advice in online communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other symptoms people may mask are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Stimming" (e.g. rocking or hand flapping, an oft misunderstood positive
        behavior), by holding it in until alone
       </li>
      <li>
        Reduced or no display of emotion through facial expressions, by studying and
        consciously emulating others
      </li>
      <li>
        Inability to cope with ambiguity, by overplanning what is controllable
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Masking comes with its own set of issues [2], particularly that it's enourmously
    exhausting. It's as if the power-hungry problem-solving parts of the brain are being
    used to emulate a missing social common sense. For me personally, this means less
    brainpower to actually problem solve -- I am literally dumber when I am with
    others.
  </p>
  <p>
    For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every day is
    the first moment alone one can "unmask", which I'd describe as a mental version of
    flopping down on the bed after a long day. Masking is a great tool and being able to
    use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">extra toll</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>A Different Way to Think About Autism</h2>
  <p>
     I didn't find out I had autism until I was 30 years old. It explained so much about
     my life. The diagnosis served as a starting point for personal research, led me to
     a community of autism "study buddies", and has landed me on some meds that help
     with the worst parts. My relationships and personal happiness have dramatically
     improved. I can't help but wonder how many people through history have needlessly
     gone through the same troubles without the benefit an "aha" moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of all human beings, 2% have autism; still many more are otherwise neurodivergent. I
    encourage you to feel comfortable, and make others feel comfortable, talking with
    family, friends, and doctors about ways you might feel different from others. It's a
    hard thing, to know if your brain is doing something different from other people's
    brains -- to try to reach a conclusion with a sample size of 1 and no control.
  </p>
  <p>
    If someone talks to you about ways they feel atypical, be open to the idea that they
    might be onto something, instead of dismissing it because you haven't witnessed
    anything on the outside. They may in the end get the first step out of the dark: a
    mere description of what is wrong.
