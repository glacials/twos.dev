ASLEEP</a>, which was shared with

<hr/>



<p>Pretty much anyone who has watched any family sitcom or movie knows that a lot
of the comedy that comes out of things like that is through certain main
characters getting frustrated, angry or fed-up with someone or something.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s a little vague. Let me give an example.</p>

<p>Right now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_We_There_Yet%3F" target="_blank"><em>Are We There
Yet?</em></a> is on TV, and I’ve been
passively watching it. One of the scenes involves the two kids Nick (the main
character, played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube" target="_blank">Ice Cube</a>) is
taking care of pretty much stealing his car. They trick him into getting out of
the car, then they lock the doors and speed around the parking lot.</p>

<p>Ha-ha, comedic scene. That’s what I want to talk about.</p>

<p>As a side-note, I have nothing against this movie; it just happens to be the
most handy example.</p>

<p>I can only assume, and I guess I can understand, that most people find those
kinds of things funny. But for some reason, I just don’t. Instead of laughing or
just saying “Those silly kids”, I kinda hate them at the moment. As much as if
they were doing that kind of stuff to me.</p>

<p>I don’t know why; I just hate them. It’s like I get too attached to the
characters or something. I understand their feelings too much.</p>

<p>And I’ve got to say, it really bugs me. I can no longer watch <em>Everybody Loves
Raymond</em> comfortably <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I admit, it was getting old anyway, but it’s just so
annoying now. Every time Marie makes a passing insult at Debra, or every time
Debra does something crazy to Ray <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> like throw a spoonful of brownie mix in his
face for making a stupid remark <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I just get so angry.</p>

<p>It’s like <em>I’m</em> the victim, like <em>I</em> just got a spoonful of liquid chocolate in
my face just for saying something stupid by accident. I mean, imagine if that
was you. Imagine if you accidentally said something stupid or insulting (we all
have) to a spouse (or friend), and they just gave you this death stare and threw
a spoonful of chocolate in your face.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’d be hella pissed. I mean, that would be totally
unnecessary. I’d get so mad, I don’t even know what I’d do to cool off.</p>

<p><em>So why is this funny on TV?</em> I can understand that things on TV can be funnier
than similar things in real life (believe me; I’m a hardcore <em>Seinfeld</em> fan),
but I don’t know about this whole anger thing. As far as I know I haven’t met
anyone else who has this problem (not that I ask upon meeting someone or
anything).</p>

<p>It’s a real burden on a person, relating to a fictional character’s emotions. I
go through so many internal mood changes so quickly it’s ridiculous.</p>

<p>What’s weird is that I never show them, though. In fact, sometimes it’s the
opposite: I’ve often been accused of looking depressed or angry when I’m just in
deep thought.</p>

<p>And I like being in deep thought. Because all the emotions in deep thought are
my own.</p>

<p>That, and Deep Thought calculated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything" target="_blank">The
Answer</a>.</p>
