<h1>Things I've learned today</h1>

<p>So I played through <em>Halo 3</em> today with a friend, start to finish, and I have to
say, I kinda don’t like it at all. I loved <em>Halo</em>; <em>Halo 2</em> was great; but <em>Halo
3</em>…meh.</p>

<p>I’m a big storyline person. I love getting involved in the events of a game. A
big reason I bought the game (I don’t even have a 360 and had to get a friend to
lend his to me under the sole condition that I <em>give him the game</em> when I’m
done) was to get some closure for the <em>Halo</em> storyline, and frankly, <em>there is
none</em>. There are <em>so many</em> questions left unanswered at the end of the game; too
many even if there were to be a <em>Halo 4</em>. I don’t want to get too into specifics
for those who haven’t yet played through it and still plan to, but were it not
for a few small things, the game would have almost no attracting storyline
elements <em>whatsoever</em>.</p>

<p>I admit that some parts of the game were fun, namely the last level, which was
reminiscent of the first game’s last level <em>The Maw</em>, but overall the game failed
to impress. The graphics were not at all bad, but weren’t something to drool
over (then again, we were playing split-screen on a 19-inch TV). I’d much prefer
not necessarily the graphics, but maybe the graphical feel of Wii’s Metroid
Prime 3, my last favorite console game.</p>

<p>On a separate but related note, playing console FPS’s constantly makes me
realize how much I love PC games. It seems trivial, but when you’re in an
intense situation, and you need to turn 180 degrees around, and with a console
you can only push the control stick so far in one direction and actually have to
<em>wait</em> for your character to turn all the way around, it gets pretty annoying
and sets some serious pace limits. On a PC, you’re in full control <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> your
character’s movements actually <em>correspond</em> to your mouse; there’s no center
that you need to reset to when you’re done turning.</p>

<p>If this is hard to understand, just think about what I said <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> imagine you’re
playing <em>Halo</em> right now (or just go play it), and you want to spin around to
face the other way. You hold the control stick down one direction until you’re
there, right? It might take a second or less (depending on your sensitivity).
Now imagine the same situation on a PC. You just go <em>VRRP!</em> and you’re there
(yes, that’s my sound effect for a mouse).</p>

<p>So <strong>anyways</strong>, some PC games I’m excited for now are <em>Portal</em> and <em>Half-Life 2:
Episode 2</em>. I’ve already been playing the <em>Team Fortress 2</em> beta and it’s pretty
freaking sweet (they’ve even implemented rankings, just like BF2/2142!).</p>

<p>And this time going completely off-topic: did you know <em>fell</em> is a word!? I
don’t mean the past tense of <em>fall</em>; I mean you can actually go <em>fell</em> something
(i.e. I <a href="https://ninjawords.com/fell">felled</a> that tree yesterday!). Woo, good
times.</p>

<p>Ugh, I could totally follow that up with an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">ATLA</a> quote…</p>
