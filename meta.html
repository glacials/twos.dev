<p>There's a unique advantage in working on twos.dev over anything I’ve worked on: it has just one developer, me. I can therefore design the developer experience in obnoxious and unintuitive ways to serve my peculiarities.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to ruthlessly optimize for two goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>It must be easy to publish writing</li>
<li>As long as I'm alive, URLs must not change</li>
</ol>

<p>In some ways these goals work against each other; easy creation usually means easy destruction. So I divide my content into two types, warm and cold. Warm content is easy to create and edit, while cold content is hard to break.</p>

<h2>Warm Content</h2>

<p>I used to write drafts in my notes app then migrate to HTML when the piece became less amorphous; from then on I would write and edit directly in HTML. This was surprisingly refreshing as it allowed me to have wild one-off customizations for individual posts, but it had three problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Writing HTML is a rough context switch (what was scribbling drafts on my phone became sitting at my computer in <code>$EDITOR</code>)</li>
<li>Writing was slowed down by cruft like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code></li>
<li>The reading experience can flow differently on a web page than in a notes app, leading to large rewrites after transferring</li>
</ol>

<p>To solve these issues and work towards my first goal, I needed tooling in the space between amorphous notes and strict HTML.</p>

<p>I first focused on changing my drafting app to something with more robust exporting
tools. I've jumped between <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank">iA Writer</a> and
<a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, both of which let me get my thoughts out quickly, each
with their own strengths. Importantly, they store writing as Markdown. This solves <code>1</code>
and <code>2</code> above.</p>

<p>To solve <code>3</code>, we need to automate getting those rough drafts published to an unlisted
twos.dev page every time they change. This means we need programmatic access to the
drafts, but neither app has a third-party web API. Luckily, the editors can store the
files in the location of your choosing, including some natively supported cloud storage
services. We need to get at those files.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this. The simplest would be to point your writing "vault"
directly at a cloud storage service with an API like Google Drive, then use something
like a cron-based GitHub Actions workflow to ensure your writing always gets published.</p>

<p>Since I'm still undergoing <a href="apple.html">my Apple experiment</a>, I've set myself a
constraint of only using iCloud Drive for cloud storage, which doesn't have an API. That
leaves two options.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>iOS and macOS ship with
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752" target="_blank">Shortcuts</a>, a no-code
event-driven automation app. Using Shortcuts, I set up an automation that triggers when
I switch away from the my writing app, and additionally on a cron. The automation adds a
1-2 line <a href="winter.html#frontmatter">Winter frontmatter</a> section to each document if
needed, then pushes it to the <code>src/warm</code> directory in the twos.dev Git repository by
invoking <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com" target="_blank">Working Copy</a>. No interruption to UX; this happens
in the background.</p>

<p>I never thought a phone would be an integral part of my CI/CD pipeline, but here we are.
It actually hummed along in the background for several months until an iOS update
changed some minor behavior somewhere that broke it. I didn't have the motivation to fix
it because the debugging experience for Shortcuts isn't great, but otherwise this was a
surprisingly effective solution and it always triggered exactly when it was needed.</p>

<p>That leads us to our second option.</p>

<h3><code>launchd</code></h3>

<p>There's no network API into iCloud Drive, but there is a local one: the filesystem. If
we control a Mac that will be online enough to satisfy our synchronization needs, which
are not necessarily 24/7, we can snatch the files from there.</p>

<p>Enter
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-CH1-SW2" target="_blank">launchd</a>,
a hidden gem of macOS. It's a few things, but for our purposes it's basically cron
purpose-built for laptops. It intelligently handles sleep, network loss, and (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-is-power-nap-mh40773/mac" target="_blank">charge
state</a>). The
specifics aren't important; suffice it to say It Just Works.</p>

<p>As long as we install this on a machine or machines that get enough use<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>or that are
<a href="https://caffeinated.app" target="_blank">Caffeinated</a> enough<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>this will be a good enough pipeline. We
have our draft synchronization.</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>

<p>On push, GitHub Actions builds the Markdown file into HTML with all the <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/c59cc1a/winter/document.go#L408-L436" target="_blank">right preprocessing</a> required to make it look like twos.dev. I use a small subset of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/html/template" target="_blank"><code>html/template</code></a> to allow myself to put things like MP4 screen recordings and dark-mode-aware images into Markdown. This is also where the frontmatter from before is stripped and parsed into metadata inserted elsewhere on the page.</p>

<p>Technically at this point the page is now published, just not linked to from anywhere. I can see how it looks in the context of twos.dev, and send the link to friends who have offered to review.</p>

<h2>Cold Content</h2>

<p>There are 2-3 needs warm content doesn't cover: first, this odd pipeline that uses my phone for CI is not something I have high confidence in, so I'd like to limit its blast radius to content that benefits from it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>content I'm actively working on<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and keep safe the innocent bystanders that are historical content.</p>

<p>Second, once in a while I need some wacky one-off piece of code for a single post, like the CSS-only spectrum in <a href="autism.html">Anonymously Autistic</a> or the variable-width font requirements of <a href="dashes.html">Advanced Dashes</a>. iA Writer is great for prose, but when it's time to write code I need to be back in <code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>

<p>Cold content exists to serve these needs. At the most basic level, cold content is just warm content that has been moved to a directory outside the reach of the warm pipeline. This is content I only touch with <code>$EDITOR</code>, like a normal code repository.</p>

<p>To fully turn warm content cold, there is a small amount of bookkeeping.</p>

<h3>Winter</h3>

<p>To handle this bookkeeping along with the other build pipeline steps, I wrote the <a href="https://twos.dev/winter" target="_blank">Winter</a> CLI. Winter can handle the process of converting warm content to cold like so:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">winter freeze DOCUMENT
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>which more or less performs a <code>git mv src/{cold,warm}/DOCUMENT.md</code> plus chips.</p>

<p>Winter also handles all the static generation. Writing my own generator was an
important step in building longevity into twos.dev because I often switch tools
when I discover a small feature I want but don't have (put simply: "oo shiny")
and that switching of tools is what eventually erodes the content.</p>

<p>Many static site generators are open source, but I'll often prefer to switch
tools than learn how to contribute if the barrier to entry contribution is
high, such as a language I don't like writing or an overly complex architecture.</p>

<p>Writing the generator myself guarantees that barrier is minimal. Writing it in
Go is a guarantee the code will not rot quickly or fall into dependency hell
after a few years without attention.</p>

<h3>Post-freeze</h3>

<p>After freezing my content I may also take one final step of permanently
rendering it to HTML if I've built more than a little code into it. Sure I can
always embed HTML in Markdown, but taking this extra step gives me all my editor
doodads and hardens the file against future changes to preprocessing.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">winter build
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">mv dist/DOCUMENT.html src/cold/DOCUMENT.html
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">git rm src/cold/DOCUMENT.md
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">git add src/cold/DOCUMENT.html
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>This brings back the weight of editing prose in HTML, but these cases are the minority and at this point most of the writing is done.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Allowing myself this escape hatch is freeing. I’m more encouraged to write interactive or otherwise bespoke components, and twos.dev becomes consistent by default but in a way I can break when I need (e.g. for a <a href="cv.html">CV</a>'s bicolumnar layout).</p>

<h2>On URLs Not Changing</h2>

<p>I use my website as a test bed for interesting technology. As a side effect, content has been lost over the years as it becomes hard to migrate to overhauled versions.</p>

<p>It so happens that by keeping my writing in Markdown or raw HTML/CSS, I make it easy to accomplish my second goal: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI" target="_blank">cool URLs don’t change</a>. I've removed the possibility that changing frontend or backend frameworks will leave my documents behind; Markdown is not going anywhere, and all the HTML files need to look decent is a header and footer. In the worst case scenario I'll simply <code>cp -r dist</code> to my next crazy system's web root.</p>

<p>If I’ve done things right, this web page will be accessible at twos.dev/meta.html for at least as long as I live.</p>
