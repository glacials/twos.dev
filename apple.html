        <h1>From Google to Apple</h1>

        <p>
          My life is in Google more than anyone I know. The usual suspects sure -- Gmail, Photos, Chrome, etc. -- but also the ones people stay away
          from -- Tasks, Keep, YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies
          &amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a
          beta user for the first Chromebook, the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue
          than most from services being sent to the “Google graveyard”. And for
          a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture with a Google+
          logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it's no surprise I’ve been
          an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats.
          This is how I understand why -- or whether -- I prefer what I chose.
          For Android, that means trialing an iPhone.
          <a
            href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw"
            >I did this</a
          >
          five years ago for a few months (thanks
          <a href="https://bensw.com">bensw</a>), but afterwards I thought "It's
          actually not that different, it's just that the Google apps don't feel
          native, so I’ll stick with Android".
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I've realized it’s hard to know the Apple value
          proposition without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the
          same reason Google apps don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn't shine if you
          only use Google apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an
          honest, holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me
          out, but better to trap myself on one side and know both, than trap
          myself on the other and know one. These are my notes on hopping the
          fence.
        </p>

        <h2>Broad Themes</h2>
        Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I'll
        summarize the themes I've witnessed during them.

        <h3>Safety vs. Freedom</h3>
        <p>
          In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I'd long ago
          published its Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding
          denial after denial. I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user,
          and I could see with fresh eyes the effects of the strictness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating
          system. They don't feel like they were written by others, and that
          makes me feel safe. My data feels like part of my device, not part of
          Google. And I trust my device to manage my payment, location, etc.
          data, because it is mine. I own it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight
          for it. But it's a good feeling. And it only comes with control -- control by a representative I trust, over parties I don't. I don't
          know app developers, especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through
          them I can trust app developers, but only because Apple so heavily
          controls what they can publish. They can't send me to their sketchy
          site or use dark patterns to trick me into paying them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don't feel
          safe, I have the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I
          have "the choice" to do a food safety inspection of every restaurant I
          visit, but I do not want to and I wouldn't know what I'm looking for,
          so I trust my local health department.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go
          through the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means
          Apple takes a cut of everything. As a user, this means one central
          place where I can manage (read: cancel) subscriptions -- no digging
          through menus or talking to customer service agents.
        </p>

              media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
            />
            <img
              src="img/apple-subscriptions-light.png"
              style="max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%"

            <img

          </p>
        </center>
        <p>
          Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party
          auth providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means
          building another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this
          means I get a native, one-tap, FaceID sign-in.

        <p>
          These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see
          the more I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing
          "public goods", whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad
          clickthrough -- data, eyeballs, and engagement. Of course, this has
          its problems. Apple is a private company, not elected officials, so is
          only as beholden to its end users as the person in charge wants it to
          be. But these are the broad strokes differences I've found between
          Apple and Google.
        </p>

        <h3>Offline-first vs. Online-first Design</h3>

        <p>
          Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in
          attitude Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user
          identity. To Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is
          just a window into that account. The device may have some caching and
          synchronization to remain useful offline, but ultimately Google's
          servers are the source of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data
          between multiple devices, but it's just that -- synchronization. Apps
          usually wait until the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you
          can even sync with a cable (or not at all) instead of iCloud.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some ways these differences are expressed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Google Docs documents are rows in a database, where Apple Pages
            documents are files on a filesystem; sharing and synchronization are
            handled by iCloud which is more akin to Dropbox in this mode. It
            does support 100 simultaneous writers, but I'm not sure how.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a
            phone number or email), not an Apple account -- even if the bubble
            is blue. You may be unknowingly using a combination of phone and
            email for one contact, because iMessage silently interleaves them if
            they're owned by the same Apple account. If that person later
            removes one from their Apple account, your iMessage thread with them
            retroactively splits.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call
            from your computer, you're going through Google's servers. In the
            Apple ecosystem, when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad,
            you're connecting locally to your iPhone to route the call.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic
          always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly
          experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a
          machine are centralized in iCloud settings where they're often off by
          default. I still can't get one of my Safaris to synchronize its
          bookmarks with the rest.
        </p>

        <a name="macos"></a>
        <h3>ArchLinux → macOS</h3>

        <p>
          I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a
          decade, so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass
          migration. I grew up gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for
          development due to a love of the POSIX command line and the simplicity
          of the system. I found macOS to scratch the same itches without the
          days spent customizing and debugging things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use
          to apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and,
          including taps, a breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it)
          the AUR. It also bundles its own service management, e.g.
          <code>brew services start postgresql</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between
          Windows security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It's good
          enough that it stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I'll
          have to type my password to unlock 1Password here and there.
        </p>

        <a name="ipad"></a>
        <h3>Nexus 7 → iPad</h3>

        <p>
          My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it
          should give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it
          room-to-room.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user
          to be using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero
          apps used the tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually
          worse than using the same app on my phone. I expected a more polished
          but overall similar experience from iPad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some
          light computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the
          form factor; apps use it to display more and differently laid out
          information. Generally, the extra horizontal space is used to
          persistently display a nav menu or the previous screen.

        <p>
          A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw
          this as a marketing move, but I've learned they really did push the
          needle more in the direction of general-purpose computing. The three
          features that did it for me are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple windows for one app</li>
          <li>Files app</li>
          <li>Better multitasking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but
          being able to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply
          feels great.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second
          monitor, and the ability to use my Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control
          the iPad. macOS’s Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input
          device for signing documents and marking up images. This is something
          I did before by manually transferring files, but now it’s two clicks
          with instant sync.
        </p>

        <a name="iphone"></a>
        <h3>Pixel → iPhone</h3>

        <p>
          I was initially surprised iPhone and iPad lack feature parity. This
          first came up trying to swipe-type on iPad. Another is iPad can show
          multiple apps on the screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. iPad has no
          Wallet or Apple Pay. I felt confused at first, but I see Apple’s angle -- none of these quite make sense on the other form factor. They’d
          rather deny you the feature than allow using it to be confusing or
          unintuitive. Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad because
          Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more native apps I use on iOS, the better the UX gets. For
          example, you can use multi-touch to drag-and-drop items between apps.
          Third-party apps only implement this functionality sometimes.

        <a name="fi"></a>
        <h4>Google Fi</h4>
        <p>
          When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier.
          We decided to stay with it because they'd recently started to
          officially support iPhone. However, after about a year we found out
          that Google Fi had been intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages
          from iPhones, leading a friend and I to think we were ghosting each
          other. Once we learned this, we immediately switched.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I
          can't see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and
          long-term bug that was never even communicated.
        </p>

        <a name="notifications"></a>
        <h4>Notifications</h4>

        <p>
          Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that
          difference makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call
          them a sidegrade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail
          notification on your phone then read that email on any platform, the
          notification goes away. Otherwise, the notification will be there even
          days later. In this way, Android notifications can be used as a todo
          list of sorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the
          notification is (usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the
          phone is unlocked the notification moves to a secondary location
          “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen. I do inbox zero, so this is
          strictly worse. I forget to address notifications by committing the
          cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers
          in the corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android
          notifications are, so can be used as a todo list. I’ve found these a
          decent enough substitute, although I still prefer Android’s
          notifications.
        </p>

        <a name="imessage"></a>
        <h4>iMessage</h4>

        <p>
          I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me
          about “solving” mobile chat -- it’s been solved for them for years.
          iMessage is the gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the
          guilty urge to nudge friends towards iPhone so I can use it with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In classic Apple fashion iMessages aren’t between Apple accounts, but
          devices. I recently changed my email address but I need to keep my old
          one in my Apple account indefinitely so my friends’ threads with me
          won’t retroactively split into two.
        </p>

        <h3>Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV</h3>

        <p>
          We don’t have HomePods and my spouse forbids me to get any after
          filling our home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away
          from “hey Google, play $SHOW”.
        </p>

        <a name="remote"></a>
        <h4>The Remote</h4>

        <p>
          Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond
          that it's pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward
          and hard to use; I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to
          click on the wrong thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise it has a good build quality and feels good in the hand. But
          it’s a remote and can be lost. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that
          attaches to the coffee table. I miss the remote-free life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is
          selected on the Apple TV, a notification shows on my iOS devices
          allowing me to use them as a keyboard. Password manager support works
          as normal; this is helpful for invoking 1Password to fill logins.
        </p>

        <a name="home"></a>
        <h3>Google Home → Apple Home</h3>

        <p>
          My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent
          building up our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a
          Raspberry Pi made it all work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV
          showing our Nest doorbell camera picture-in-picture when the doorbell
          rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home
          Hub.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list
          that feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a
          breeze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT
          gateway, having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center
          pull-down menus, and hooking up more devices through automation with
          Shortcuts.
        </p>

        <a name="airpods"></a>
        <h3>Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro</h3>

        <p>
          Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is
          true. Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten
          they’re in my ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35
          IIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between
          devices based on attention, and Siri integration slightly worse than
          Pixel Buds's Google Assistant imtegration.
        </p>

        <a name="mail"></a>
        <h3>Gmail → iCloud Mail</h3>

        <p>
          The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I
          control anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the
          experience was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired
          result. After starting from scratch several times, I’ve chosen to live
          the life of searching in two places when I need something.
        </p>
        <p>
          The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve
          installed Thunderbird to get by.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and
          has a solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability
          issues:
        </p>
        <p>
          Mail's junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk
          folder, even after months of correcting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud
          Drive links instead, but I've had recipients experience trouble
          downloading them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mail's search is bad. On macOS, it searches only the mailbox being
          viewed (e.g. Inbox) by default. Because I do inbox zero, this is never
          what I want to search. (iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by
          default.) When you are done searching and click Inbox to "return home"
          the search field doesn't clear, leading you to believe your Inbox is
          empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring that, Gmail still wins search by an order of magnitude. For
          example, Gmail searches the contents of PDFs attached to emails; I’ve
          found this invaluable finding old leases and whatnot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mail is okay at displaying emails as conversations. Once in a while,
          it omits something it shouldn’t. When I click Send while replying to a
          thread it doesn't immediately append my message, causing me to believe
          something went wrong. I experience long, uncollapsible nested quotes
          in some emails, where Gmail was always good at collapsing them
          automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service
          has a separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have
          disparate feature sets and don't synchronize. iOS Mail does not
          support filters. I’ve opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because
          the iCloud filters can only check one condition per filter, and I just
          have my iMac stay awake 24/7.
        </p>
        <p>
          macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to
          archive. Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for
          any app.

          former Apple engineer on Mail to have a similar UX but using proper
          Gmail APIs.

        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in
          Spotlight and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.

        <a name="calendar"></a>
        <h3>Google Calendar → Apple Calendar</h3>

        <p>
          After migrating calendars but before transitioning my custom-domain
          email address to iCloud Mail, my email was serviced by Google
          Workspace. I had this Google Workspace account added to my iPhone and
          iPad. This got me into a weird state where Calendar would not let me
          add an event to my iCloud calendar if the invitee was that email
          address, but it would allow me to add it to that Google account's
          calendar. When I removed that Google account from my device, I could
          add the event to my iCloud calendar fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't recommend using the Week view in Calendar. Like Google
          Calendar, Apple Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to represent the
          current time of day; but this bar extends 100% of the width of the
          week, and does not do a good job showing you which day today is.
        </p>
        <center>
          <picture>
            <source
              srcset="img/apple-calendar-dark.png"
              media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
            />
            <img
              src="img/apple-calendar-light.png"
              style="max-height: 57em; max-width: 100%"
            />
          </picture>
          <p>
            <i>
              Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it
              is?
            </i>
          </p>
        </center>
        <p>
          This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing
          panic about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar
          only shows when viewing today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say
          they appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a
          calendar invitation there are two attachments,
          <code>invite.ics</code> and <code>mime-attachment.ics</code>. Each
          will pop up a Calendar float to add the event; I’ve learned to use
          <code>mime-attachment.ics</code> because it seems to open a two-way
          connection with the sender’s event, where
          <code>invite.ics</code> seems to be a local copy.

          Google Calendar is the stickiest part of the Google ecosystem due to
          the features they’ve built on top of vanilla calendaring and their
          ubiquity. Interactions with Google Calendar users, which in my
          experience is everyone, always leave me with a feeling of unease: “did
          they get this RSVP?” or “did their event update with the new time?”.
          For some use cases, Calendar will RSVP by sending an email from your
          account with a plaintext description of your response. I haven’t
          discovered yet if these are seen by human eyes or interpreted
          automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed
          to have a refresh in a decade. Calendar can automatically generate
          “travel to” and “travel from” events based on the travel time between
          locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps and Siri
          suggestions for navigation destinations and video call links.
        </p>

        <a name="maps"></a>
        <h3>Google Maps → Apple Maps</h3>

        <p>
          Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly
          so. But that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately it’s only gotten good, not great. There are UX benefits
          over Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past this light,
          then at the next one, turn
          <code>$DIRECTION</code>”, but about 5% of my trips to new places end
          me at the right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been routed
          to the delivery entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an
          airport, and the wrong parking lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) of a
          large shopping center.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m continuing to give it chances because I know more data helps, but
          for tight schedules I go back to Google Maps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there's the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos,
          menus, ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here;
          their purchase of Yelp means they inherit photos & reviews, but even
          that can't beat the sheer volume
          Google Maps. I've only seen one or two restaurants with ordering
          functionality enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and
          Calendar, Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other
          sources, and Apple Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming
          turns.
        </p>

        <a name="findmy"></a>
        <h4>Location Sharing &rarr; Find My</h4>

        <p>
          I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends
          and family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple
          offering (a separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one
          would be happy with the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must
          launch with intention, but it's a wash for me -- I've had
          serendipitous encounters enabled by seeing a friend is close by in
          Google Maps accidentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          AirTags and device tracking are the big Apple killer feature here,
          which work as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one
          in my bag just to have peace of mind. The app sends a notification
          when I leave $DEVICE at $LOCATION, with easy controls to disable

        <a name="safari"></a>
        <h3>Chrome → Safari</h3>

        <p>
          This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from
          bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the
          Chrome chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone
          applications even when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go
          backward or forward slides the page on/off screen allowing you to peek
          without navigating, but it backfires and feels
          artificial for low-travel anchor links and some single-page app
          transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the
          navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can't
          identify.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it works it's beautiful and useful, but when it doesn't it's
          jarring.

          I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced
          some webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others (local only); Meet
          also supports more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one
          tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff, which allows a browsing
          session to smoothly transition from device to device.

        <a name="keychain"></a>
        <h4>iCloud Keychain</h4>

        <p>
          While moving to Safari, I replaced 1Password with iCloud Keychain. It
          serves basic needs, but that’s it. It can store a username, a
          password, a 2FA code, and a domain name for each entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          It cannot store two domains for one entry, e.g. gmail.com and
          google.com. It cannot store arbitrary notes on an entry, e.g. the PIN
          that T-Mobile customer service agents ask for. It cannot name an
          entry, e.g. Washington Corporations and Charities System instead of
          ccfs.sos.wa.gov. It cannot store non-login entries like documents, ID
          numbers, or insurance information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the 2FA field involves manual effort. Scanning rarely works, so
          I enter the 2FA secret by copying and pasting the code. Some sites
          provide a raw code, while others wrap the code in a URL that contains
          other metadata. 1Password accepts either, but iCloud Keychain assumes
          you hand it a code; if you hand it a URL it will silently accept it
          but produce incorrect codes.
        </p>
        <p>I moved back to 1Password.</p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include faster and more fluid
          autofill support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS.
        </p>

        <a name="numbers"></a>
        <h3>Google Sheets → Numbers</h3>

        <p>
          As a casual spreadsheets user, Sheets and Numbers are nearly
          identical. Numbers has nicer UX when editing formulae that visualizes
          cell(s) being referenced. It tries to humanize references, e.g. “Ben
          age” for a cell in a row with header “Ben” and a column with header
          “Age”, instead of A:123. This is nice until headers get long and
          multiworded. Overall it’s a wash.
        </p>

        <a name="pages"></a>
        <h3>Google Docs → Pages</h3>

        <p>(To be filled in; I have not had much Pages experience.)</p>

        <a name="notes"></a>
        <h3>Keep → Notes</h3>

        <p>
          I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking -- get out of my way
          and let me write, then let me deal with it later. Keep supplies that.
          Its layout is hard to browse, but it makes up for it with great
          search.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on
          shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform, with roughly
          the same text formatting options as Markdown (unfortunately without
          the markup). Instead of adding several notes to a category or color in
          Keep, I append to an existing note that contains several thoughts.
          This keeps the number of notes down, which makes categorization more
          reasonable, which improves browsing.
        </p>
        <p>For me, it’s a wash between the two.</p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts and cross-app
          drag-and-drop. I use a shortcut to create a new note titled and sorted
          correctly before starting a Chinese lesson.
        </p>

        <a name="reminders"></a>
        <h3>Tasks → Reminders</h3>

        <p>
          Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS. Reminders can be
          scheduled to “pop” at a date, a date and time, a location, and/or when
          messaging <code>$PERSON</code>. Reminders can belong to lists (e.g.
          work vs. personal), lists can be shared (e.g. family chores), and
          reminders within shared lists can be assigned to people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reminders have a name, description, URL field, and priority (higher
          priority reminders are sorted higher and given special UI treatment).
          Reminders can have images attached to them, and any number of
          subtasks. They can be tagged and flagged.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a powerful app, but everything is presented simply. There is a
          native macOS app that synchronizes, so I get proper notifications on
          most of my devices. In app, I use the “Today” view which shows
          reminders ready to be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one use case, my spouse and I share a family reminders list. On
          that list, a reminder to take out the trash pops every trash day when
          I arrive home. It’s assigned to me, but if she happens to do it before
          I get home she can check it off; it then won't pop for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share
          sheet in native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in
          the URL field) and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder
          (if any) on my Apple Watch homescreen.
        </p>

        <a name="siri"></a>
        <h3>Google Assistant → Siri</h3>

        <p>
          Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can't answer
          questions like "What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?" or
          "Who played Alan in Tron Legacy?".
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Siri include surface-level interaction with
          native apps: setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home
          devices, etc.
        </p>

        <a name="shortcuts"></a>
        <h3>Google Assistant Routines / Tasker → Shortcuts</h3>
        <p>
          I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most
          power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations
          I had around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it
          to shell scripts.

          As one example, I like to write in an app called iA Writer. I use
          Shortcuts to automatically commit and push my writing to this website
          daily. Because iA Writer stores files in iCloud, and another app
          called Working Copy can interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets
          me glue them together:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>(Working Copy) Pull from <code>twos.dev</code> remote</li>
          <li>
            (iOS) Get contents of folder <code>iCloud/iA Writer/Published</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            (Working Copy) Write contents of folder to <code>./src</code> in
            <code>twos.dev</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            (Working Copy) Stage <code>./src</code> in <code>twos.dev</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            (Working Copy) Commit <code>twos.dev</code> with message “Automatic
            commit by iA Writer sync job”
          </li>
          <li>(Working Copy) Push <code>twos.dev</code> to remote</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I
          could do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say
          that my phone is a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.

        <a name="drive"></a>
        <h3>Google Drive &rarr; iCloud Drive</h3>
        <p>
          Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception.
          Use it if you're in the Apple ecosystem, and don't if you're not.
          Otherwise, the only benefit it has over Google Drive is that it
          synchronizes everything to disk instead of mounting a network drive -- or at least, its UX makes it feel that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow
          between your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for
          first-party and some third-party apps to use it as a default data
          store anyway (e.g. Pages saves documents there, Numbers saves
          spreadsheets there).
        </p>
        <p>
          It also seems macOS pulls a trick where it allows you to open files
          that haven't fully synced by delaying the open action until the sync
          is complete. This gives some unnoticed benefit for small files like
          documents and images, but backfires with large files and/or slow
          connections and has caused me to think my computer was being very slow
          when trying to play a video file that hadn't fully synced.
        </p>

        <a name="music"></a>
        <h3>YouTube Music → Apple Music</h3>
        <p>
          Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified
          a lot of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator
          workflow that would move the cursor to my existing library, select and
          copy a title, then move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and
          add the top result.
        </p>
        <p>
          The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with
          the iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app.
          Navigation is slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact
          that it takes too many transitions to get where you’re going. For
          details on its UX failings, see
          <a href="https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem"

        <p>I miss Google Play Music.</p>
        <p>
          Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration
          and better Siri support for when I’m driving and want to play
          something.
        </p>

        <a name="pay"></a>
        <h3>Google Pay → Apple Pay</h3>
        <p>
          I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me
          embarrassed to use it. It was hard to find "the spot" on credit card
          machines to tap. Apple Pay feels more spatially generous; once I start
          hunting for the spot, it's already been found. It could be because the
          iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of the device while Pixels have
          them in the middle, or maybe the world has just gotten better at this
          since then. I'm now using Apple Pay every chance I get.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apparent meta for credit card companies in the US is to give
          customers either 1.5% cash back on everything, or 1% back on
          everything and 2-5% back on specific categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apple Card gives 2% back on everything purchased through Apple Pay
          and 1% on everything else, which is the best deal I've seen. (There
          are also some merchants that do 3%, but I'm not about tracking and
          optimizing that.) Of the purchases I make in Seattle, about 80% of
          shops and restaurants who do pay-at-counter support Apple Pay, and
          about 20% of table-service restaurants do. For online orders, roughly
          half of the non-Amazon orders I place support it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first
          credit card experience that feels like it was made this century. The
          app is beautiful, snappy, and simple.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>This is a living document.</p>
        <p>
          Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the
          sum of its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned
          is that it’s the long tail of ecosystem benefits that makes up most of
          that excess. Not the two or three things per product I’ve mentioned
          above, but the dozens that happen without me noticing that add up to
          make a more enjoyable experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are
          functional benefits to working in a clean space -- it’s easier to find
          things, spilling a liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less
          dust -- but the bulk of the benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways
          the space feels better and motivates more.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 2022 May, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would
          not count it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell
          and I'll continue to document my journey here.
