    <article><p>TODO: USB-C (maybe?), Touch Bar, SMS in macOS,</p><h1>From Google to Apple</h1><p>My life is in Google more than anyone I know. The usual suspects, sure -- Gmail, Photos, Chrome, and the like, but also the ones people stay away from—Stadia, Tasks, One, Keep, YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp; TV, Podcasts. We have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook, the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the “Google graveyard” like Allo and Hangouts. For a few years I was gung-ho enough to overlay my Facebook profile picture with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. (How embarrassing that eventually was!)</p><p>I’ve been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them with Nexus and Pixel devices. But once in a while I try to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is how I understand why—or whether—I really prefer what I chose. But when I've previously trialed a borrowed iPhone for a few months (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/bensw">@bensw</a>), my thoughts amounted to &quot;It's not that different, except the Google apps don't have any OS integration&quot;.</p><p>I've realized since then it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition without being immersed in the ecosystem. For the same reason the Google Assistant doesn't shine iOS, iOS doesn't shine if you only use Google apps.</p><p>After a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided now’s a good time to give Apple an honest shot. The infamous walled garden may not let me out, but better to trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know one. This is my story of hopping the fence.</p><h2>The Plan</h2><p>I use a Mac for development, but otherwise use no Apple devices. Google’s tablet game has been nonexistent for a few years, so iPad seems a good place to start. Starting there, I’ll tiptoe my way into the ecosystem, checking deltas as I go. Each piece I add theoretically adds value to each existing piece. For example, iPads can be used as external displays for Macs. I'll document my journey here.</p><h2>Execution</h2><h3>Precondition: MacBook</h3><p>I have used one or another Mac as a development machine since I switched from the Cr-48 in 2013, which was running ArchLinux at the time.</p><h3>iPad</h3><p>My goal for a tablet is to replace all my at-home phone use. It gives an upgraded experience and as a bonus, drains a different battery bank than the one I may need later. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.</p><p>My last tablet was a Nexus 7, but within a year I’d stopped that habit. It afforded too little benefit and took too much effort to maintain separately from my phone. Apps didn’t expect one user to be using two devices, so bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the tablet form factor well (or at all), making the UX worse than a phone. I expected a similar experience from iPad.</p><p>Replacements afforded:</p><ul><li>None</li></ul><h4>Thoughts</h4><p>With iPad, I’ve carried it room to room for two years now. The app ecosystem better understands the tablet form factor; many apps use it to display more information or at least differently laid out information. The multitasking experience is opinionated but helpful.</p><h4>Ecosystem Benefits</h4><ul><li>Sidecar (use iPad as external monitor for Mac)</li><li>Universal Control (use mouse and keyboard from Mac to control iPad)</li><li>macOS Preview lets you use an iOS device to annotate or sign a document, in one click. This was my first exposure to the synergy of the ecosystem; anyone can transfer an image to a touchscreen device for editing, but doing it in one click and having it show up in less than a second was magical.</li></ul><h3>iPhone</h3><p>To allow iPhone the opportunity to prove my previous opinion wrong, I’m using it as an opportunity to switch app suites.</p><p>Replacements afforded:</p><ul><li>Google Assistant → Siri (when used from phone)</li><li>Google Calendar → Apple Calendar</li><li>Google Docs → Apple Pages</li><li>Google Drive → iCloud Drive</li><li>Google Duo → FaceTime</li><li>Google Fit → Apple Health</li><li>Google Home → Apple Home</li><li>Google Keep → Apple Notes</li><li>Google Maps → Apple Maps</li><li>Google Photos → iOS Photos</li><li>Google Play Books → Apple Books</li><li>Google Play Movies &amp; TV → Apple TV (the app)</li><li>Google Podcasts → Apple Podcasts</li><li>Google Sheets → Apple Numbers</li><li>Gmail → Apple Mail</li><li>Hangouts/Chat/Messages → iMessage</li><li>YouTube Music → Apple Music</li></ul><h4>Thoughts</h4><p>After getting an iPhone the difference in the Google and Apple ethos around user identity quickly became clear. In the Google ecosystem a user is a Google account; an Android phone is one of many windows into that account. In the Apple ecosystem a user is an iPhone. The iPhone is possibly tied to an Apple account, but that’s incidental.</p><p>For example, there is no “Apple Wallet”, there is only iPhone Wallet—if you lose your iPhone, there’s no version of your wallet in the cloud to recover from. Seeing the same iMessage state on Mac as on iPhone is an opt-in feature and involves n-to-n device synchronization, not several frontends consuming one source-of-truth backend.[^I don’t know that these are the correct technical details; I’m only speaking from UX inferences.]</p><p>This is not to say I can’t use my iPad to access photos I took on my iPhone, but the focus is more on deferred synchronization than always-online. Apps that store data “in the cloud” like Pages and Shortcuts tend to do so by making a directory for themselves in iCloud Drive and using it as their file system.</p><p>This difference in approaches is refreshing, but has its limits. I regularly experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Bulk-importing hundreds or thousands of photos from my DSLR means waiting a full day for things to settle; even when I delete photos that haven’t been synced, they continue to clog the sync queue because the trash needs to be synced.</p><p>There’s a certain part of this that’s charming,  but it’s not for everyone.</p><p>One surprising iPhone quality is lack of feature parity with iPad. For example, iPhone has swipe-to-type on the software keyboard while iPad does not. iPad can show multiple apps on the screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. This was my first introduction to Apple’s strong design opinions; certainly it’d be easier to keep the two systems at feature parity, but Apple would rather disable a feature than allow a user to have a poor experience using it. Infamously, Apple has not released a calculator app for iPad because they haven’t found the time to make the design feel great (TODO: Find quote/link).</p><h5>Notifications</h5><p>Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference makes them feel a lot worse at first, but after some time I’d call them a sidegrade.</p><p>Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on your phone then read that email in any way on any platform, the notification goes away. If you don’t, the notification will still be there, even days later. In this way, Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.</p><p>iOS notifications are stateless. In the same scenario on iOS, the email notification persists until it’s tapped or until the phone is unlocked. If tapped, it’s cleared; if the phone is unlocked, the notification moves to a secondary location on the lockscreen that requires a gesture to show. In this way, iOS notifications behave more as a feed, with states for “unread” and “read”.</p><p>As someone who does inbox zero, this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications all the time. However iOS fills the gap elsehow, with badges. Badges are red numbers in the corners of app icons, and they are stateful in the same way Android notifications are. I’ve found these a decent enough substitute, although I still prefer Android’s behavior.</p><h5>iMessage</h5><p>I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about “solving” chat—it’s been solved for them already. iMessage is the gold standard of chat apps.</p><p>One note is, in Apple ecosystem fashion, you don’t community with Apple accounts, but with devices. I recently changed my email address, but I need to keep</p><h4>Ecosystem benefits</h4><ul><li>For some friends, SMS becomes iMessage</li><li>I can send and receive phone calls, SMS, and iMessages from Mac and iPad</li></ul><h3>Apple TV (hardware)</h3><p>Replacements afforded:</p><ul><li>Chromecast</li><li>Google TV</li></ul><h4>Thoughts</h4><p>We don’t have HomePods and my spouse forbids me to get any after filling our home with Google Home[ Mini]s, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey Google, play $SHOW”.</p><h5>The Remote</h5><p>Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that we’ve used the remote. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use; I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.</p><p>Otherwise it has a good build quality and feels good in the hand. But it’s a remote and can be lost. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that attaches to the coffee table. I miss the remote-free life.</p><h4>Ecosystem benefits</h4><ul><li>When a text input is selected on the Apple TV, a notification shows on my iOS devices allowing me to use them as a keyboard. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for invoking 1Password to fill logins.</li></ul><h3>Apple Home</h3><p>Replaces Google Home.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>My biggest fear was that a decade of building up Google Nest devices would be for naught, but Starling Home Hub and later Homemanager with a Nest plugin made it all work seamlessly.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>Can use Shortcuts for automation</li></ul><h3>Starling Home Hub</h3><ul><li>When my doorbell rings, my Nest camera shows up in picture-in-picture</li></ul><h3>Apple TV (service)</h3><p>Replacements afforded:</p><ul><li>None</li></ul><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Apple TV feels like early Netflix productions—everything is high quality (both technically and narratively). Ted Lasso is the most wholesome show of the last decade. See and WeCrashed are shows I’m working through but have been good—about 70-80% as good as Breaking Bad, which is my barometer these days.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>None</li></ul><h3>AirPods Pro</h3><p>Replaces Google Pixel Buds 2 and Bose QC35 II.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true. More than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my ears; transparency mode is good.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>Automatically switches between MacBook, iPad, and iPhone based on heuristics like screen-on or lid-closed</li><li>Supports Siri, but I don’t use it</li></ul><h3>iMac</h3><p>Replacements afforded:</p><ul><li>Google Code cron → macOS’s Shortcuts.app</li><li>Gmail → iCloud Mail (see below)</li></ul><p>Thoughts:</p><p>This is a used iMac from 2017; no fancy M1 chip.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>One more device AirPods Pro can switch between</li><li></li></ul><h3>Mail</h3><p>Replaces Gmail UI.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Mail's junk filter is bad. It has sorted roughly one legitimate email per week into the junk folder, even after multiple months of correcting it. Sometimes two similar emails from the same mailing list will come in around the same time, one into junk, one not.</p><p>Mail's search feature is bad. On macOS, it will assume you want to search the current mailbox, e.g. Inbox. Because I archive emails that don't need my attention, this is never what I want to search. (Mail on iOS and iPadOS correctly searches everything by default.) When you are done searching and click Inbox to &quot;return home&quot;, the search field doesn't clear on its own, leading you to believe your Inbox is empty.</p><p>Even beyond that, Gmail unsurprisingly wins search by an order of magnitude. As one example, Gmail searches the contents of PDFs attached to emails.</p><p>Mail is okay at displaying emails as conversations. Once in a while, it misses something. When you add an email to a thread and click send, it doesn't immediately appear below the thread, causing you to believe something went wrong. Presumably it's not discovered until the screen re-scans the Sent mailbox for related emails.</p><p>Mail is bad at dealing with calendar invitations. They appear as normal attachments -- two per invitation, an ICS file and one generically called &quot;Mail Attachment&quot;. You have to learn by trial and error that the ICS file is not the one you should use, although it appears to work, because it holds no ties back to the creator. Instead, you should open &quot;Mail Attachment&quot;, which will allow you to RSVP.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>Share menu feels more natively “part of” iOS, iPadOS</li><li>Gesture support on macOS</li><li>Drag-and-collect support on iOS</li></ul><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>If you use Gmail and want the UX of Mail.app, I suggest Mimestream. Created by the ex-Apple developer of Mail.app to use Gmail APIs and features instead of SMTP.</li></ul><h3>iCloud Mail</h3><p>Replaces Gmail backend.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>After seeing many harrowing stories of Google users' accounts being inexplicably banned I decided I'd start the years-long process of changing my email address, to a domain I control. Luckily, Apple released custom domain support for iCloud Mail around the same time.</p><p>The iCloud Mail web app experience is bad. With Apple's quality bar they set for themselves, I'm surprised it exists. I quickly switched to Thunderbird on my gaming computer.</p><p>Although the macOS Mail app supports auto sorting rules, these apply locally. The iCloud Mail service has a separate rules system with the same effect, but the two have disparate feature sets and don't synchronize. For example, iCloud rules can match one condition per rule -- from: or subject:, but not both.</p><p>Later, I inherited an old iMac and I have it always running so my mail always gets sorted.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>Push works for Mail when used with iCloud Mail</li></ul><h3>Calendar</h3><p>Replaces Google Calendar.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Before transitioning my custom-domain email address to iCloud Mail, it was serviced by Google Workspace; I had this Google Workspace account added to my iPhone and iPad. This got me into a weird state where Calendar would not let me add an event to my iCloud calendar if the invitee was my new email address, if that Google Workspace account was present on my device, but it would allow me to add it to that Google account's calendar. When I removed that Google account from my device, I could add the event to my iCloud calendar fine.</p><p>I don't recommend using the Week view in Calendar. Similar to Google Calendar, Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to represent the current time; however this red bar extends to occupy 100% of the width of the week, and does not do a good enough job of showing you which day today is. This has led me to mistake the wrong day of the week for today multiple times, inducing panic about being late for meetings and reaching out to people to reschedule other meetings. I now use Day view, where no red bar shows unless viewing today.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>Quick look is a blast, the same way it is for previewing files in Finder</li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><p>Replaces Google Maps.</p><h3>Safari</h3><p>Replaces Google Chrome.</p><h3>Numbers, Pages</h3><p>Replaces Google Sheets, Google Docs.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>Siri suggestions take me to specific sheets, docs</li></ul><h3>Notes</h3><p>Replaces Google Keep.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>I use Shortcuts to start my Chinese lesson, which creates a scratch note with the current date as its title and opens my Zoom meeting</li></ul><h3>Reminders</h3><p>Replaces Google Tasks and the reminders feature of Google Assistant.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><ul><li>Siri</li></ul><h3>Siri</h3><p>Replaces Google Assistant.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can't answer questions like &quot;What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?&quot; or &quot;Who played Alan in Tron Legacy?&quot;.</p><p>Otherwise, the user experience of Siri has the classic Apple pleasantness.</p><p>Ecosystem benefits:</p><h3>Shortcuts</h3><p>Replaces Google Assistant routines and apps like Tasker.</p><p>Thoughts:</p><p>I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most power user friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had around Apple not allowing a hacking mentality on iOS. I prefer it to shell scripts on a cron job.</p><p>As one example, I like to write in an app called iA Writer, and I use Shortcuts to automatically commit and push those to this website daily. Because iA Writer stores files in iCloud, and another app called Working Copy can interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:</p><ol><li>(Working Copy) Pull from TWOS.DEV remote</li><li>(iOS) Get contents of folder ICLOUD/IA WRITING/PUBLISHED</li><li>(Working Copy) Write CONTENTS OF FOLDER to ./SRC in TWOS.DEV</li><li>(Working Copy) Stage ./SRC in TWOS.DEV</li><li>Commit TWOS.DEV with message AUTOMATIC COMMIT BY IA WRITER SYNC JOB</li><li>Push TWOS.DEV to remote</li></ol><p>I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could do all this without any was impressive.</p></article>
