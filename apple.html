</body></html><h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>My life is in Google more than anyone I know. The usual suspects sure<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Gmail,
Photos, Chrome, etc.<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>but also the ones people stay away from<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Tasks, Keep,
YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We
have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook,
the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the
“Google graveyard”. And for a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture
with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it's no surprise I’ve
been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.</p>

<p>But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is
how I understand why<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>or whether<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I prefer what I chose. For Android, that
means trialing an iPhone. <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&amp;t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw">I did
this</a>
five years ago for a few months (thanks <a href="https://bensw.com">bensw</a>), but
afterwards I thought "It's actually not that different, it's just that the
Google apps don't feel native, so I’ll stick with Android".</p>

<p>Since then, I've realized it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition
without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the same reason Google apps
don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn't shine if you only use Google apps.</p>

<p>So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an honest,
holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me out, but better to
trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know
one. These are my notes on hopping the fence.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Broad Themes</h2>

<p>Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I'll summarize
the themes I've witnessed during them.</p>

<h3 id="safety">Safety vs. Freedom</h3>

<p>In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I'd long ago published its
Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding denial after denial.
I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user, and I could see with fresh
eyes the effects of the strictness.</p>

<p>Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating system. They
don't feel like they were written by others, and that makes me feel safe. My
data feels like part of my device, not part of Google. And I trust my device
to manage my payment, location, etc. data, because it is mine. I own it.</p>

<p>That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight for it.
But it's a good feeling. And it only comes with control<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>control by a
representative I trust, over parties I don't. I don't know app developers,
especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through them I can trust app
developers, but only because Apple so heavily controls what they can publish.
They can't send me to their sketchy site or use dark patterns to trick me into
paying them.</p>

<p>Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don't feel safe, I have
the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I have "the choice" to do
a food safety inspection of every restaurant I visit, but I do not want to and
I wouldn't know what I'm looking for, so I trust my local health department.</p>

<p>For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go through
the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means Apple takes a cut
of everything. As a user, this means one central place where I can manage
(read: cancel) subscriptions<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>no digging through menus or talking to customer
service agents.</p>

<p><figure style="text-align: center">

    />
  </picture>
  
  <figcaption>The App Store&#39;s subscriptions management menus.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party auth
providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means building
another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this means I get a native,
one-tap, FaceID sign-in.</p>

<p><figure style="text-align: center">
  
<video autoplay loop muted style="max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%">
  
  
    
      <source src="img/apple-signin-light.mp4" type="video/quicktime" />

</video>

  <figcaption>Signing in with Apple.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see the more
I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing "public goods",
whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad clickthrough<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>data, eyeballs,
and engagement. Of course, this has its problems. Apple is a private company,
not elected officials, so is only as beholden to its end users as it wants to
be. For now, the incentives seem aligned.</p>

<h3 id="offline">Offline-first vs. Online-first Design</h3>

<p>Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in attitude
Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user identity. To
Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is just a window into that
account. The device may have some caching and synchronization to remain useful
offline, but ultimately Google's servers are the source of truth.</p>

<p>To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data between
multiple devices, but it's just that<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>synchronization. Apps usually wait until
the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you can even sync with a cable
(or not at all) instead of iCloud.</p>

<p>Here are some ways these differences are expressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google wants a blurry line between web and native experiences; its official
apps are going the way of PWAs and similar tech that can be deployed to web
and app ~identically. In contrast Apple puts every major UX flow in a native
app, from email and calendar to bug reporting and account management. Even
uploading apps to the App Store for publishing<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a fundamentally online
experience--is a native app.</li>
<li>Google Docs documents are rows in a database, where Apple Pages documents
are files on a filesystem; sharing and synchronization are handled by iCloud
which is more akin to Dropbox in this mode. It does support 100 simultaneous
writers, but I'm not sure how.</li>
<li>When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a phone
number or email), not an Apple account<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>even if the bubble is blue. You may
be unknowingly using a combination of phone and email for one contact, because
iMessage silently interleaves them if they're owned by the same Apple account.
If that person later removes one from their Apple account, your iMessage
thread with them retroactively splits.</li>
<li>In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call from your
computer, you're going through Google's servers. In the Apple ecosystem,
when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad, you're connecting
locally to your iPhone to route the call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic
always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly
experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a machine
are centralized in iCloud settings where they're often off by default. I still
can't get one of my Safaris to synchronize its bookmarks with the rest.</p>

<h3 id="committment">Committment vs. Experimentation</h3>

<p>Google is infamous for killing products. They release early, often, and in
isolation; see Hangouts and Allo, Meet and Duo, or Reminders and Tasks.
Innovation comes first and stablizing the product offering comes second, when
the product is proven (or not proven) to work.</p>

<p>Apple instead takes the "measure twice, cut once" approach; products are
rarely released and rarely killed. The iPod was around for 21 years,
co-existing with the iPhone for 12 of them. Apple Maps was a notoriously
failed app at launch in 2012 and still suffers from that reputational injury,
however <em>it's still around anyway</em> and has improved drastically (although
whether enough is <a href="#maps">still in question</a>).</p>

<p>Google's reputation for killing products causes a negative feedback loop. When
Google releases a product that relies on market buy-in<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>say, a watch OS (needs
app developer buy-in) or a chat app (needs consumer buy-in)<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it's an uphill
battle to get the market on board, because it knows Google may turn around and
kill the product anyway. This lack of buy-in seals the product's fate, and it
goes to the graveyard.</p>

<p>In contrast, Apple's reputation for <em>not</em> killing products causes the market to
embrace it with open arms, kicking off a positive feedback loop that ensures its
success. iPad needed developers to design for a different form factor to be
successful, and they did. Apple Watch needed developers to design watch flows
for their app to be successful, and they did.</p>

<p>There are more factors at play than reputation, like developer experience and
user experience, but the point stands<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a reputation for killing products
contributes to more product deaths.</p>

<h2 id="specifics">Specific Notes</h2>

<p>Below are my notes on moving between the ecosystems at specific touchpoints.</p>

<h3 id="macos">ArchLinux → macOS</h3>

<p>I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a decade,
so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass migration. I grew up
gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for development due to a love of the
POSIX command line and the simplicity of the system. I found macOS to scratch
the same itches without the days spent customizing and debugging things.</p>

<p>Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use to
apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and, including taps, a
breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it) the AUR. It also bundles its
own service management, e.g.
<code>brew services start postgresql</code>.</p>

<p>TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between Windows
security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It's good enough that it
stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I'll have to type my password
to unlock 1Password here and there.</p>

<p>The app ethos on macOS is that all apps are self-contained <code>.app</code> files, and
uninstalling an app is defined as <code>rm</code>ing that file. It's spoiled me to
hesitation when I encounter the rare app that needs an installer.</p>

<p>Roughly half the apps I use are available on the macOS App Store. For apps it
manages, it handles updates, payments, and even
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting_app_store_reviews">prompts for
review</a>.
I generally look there first when searching for an app, then Homebrew (if I know
what I'm looking for), then Google.</p>

<h3 id="ipad">Nexus 7 → iPad</h3>

<p>My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it should
give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.</p>

<p>When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user to be
using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the
tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually worse than using the
same app on my phone. I expected a more polished but overall similar
experience from iPad.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some light
computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the form factor; apps
use it to display more and differently laid out information. Generally, the
extra horizontal space is used to persistently display a nav menu or the
previous screen.</p>

</p>

<p>A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw this as a
marketing move, but I've learned they really did push the needle more in the
direction of general-purpose computing. The three features that did it for me
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple windows for one app</li>
<li>Files app</li>
<li>Better multitasking</li>
</ul>

<p>Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but being able
to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply feels great.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second monitor, and
the ability to use my Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control the iPad. macOS’s
Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input device for signing documents
and marking up images. This is something I did before by manually transferring
files, but now it’s two clicks with instant sync.</p>

<h3 id="iphone">Pixel → iPhone</h3>

<p>I was initially surprised iPhone and iPad lack feature parity. This first came
up trying to swipe-type on iPad. Another is iPad can show multiple apps on the
screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay. I felt
confused at first, but I see Apple’s angle<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>none of these quite make sense on
the other form factor. They’d rather deny you the feature than allow using it to
be confusing or unintuitive. Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad
because Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.</p>

<p>The more native apps I use on iOS, the better the UX gets. For example, you
can use multi-touch to drag-and-drop items between apps. Third-party apps only
implement this functionality sometimes.</p>

<p>FaceID is about on par with fingerprint unlock on Pixel. They each encounter
their own situational troubles, but both are great overall and I'm no more or
less happy.</p>

<h4 id="fi">Google Fi</h4>

<p>When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier. We
decided to stay with it because they'd recently started to officially support
iPhone. However, after about a year we found out that Google Fi had been
intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages from iPhones, leading a friend
and I to think we were ghosting each other. Once we learned this, we
immediately switched.</p>

<p>Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I can't
see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and long-term bug that
was never even communicated.</p>

<h4 id="notifications">Notifications</h4>

<p>Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference
makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call them a sidegrade.</p>

<p>Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on
your phone then read that email on any platform, the notification goes away.
Otherwise, the notification will be there even days later. In this way,
Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.</p>

<p>iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the notification is
(usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the phone is unlocked the
notification moves to a secondary location “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen.
I do inbox zero, so this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications
by committing the cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.</p>

<p>However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers in the
corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android notifications
are, so can be used as a todo list. I’ve found these a decent enough
substitute, although I still prefer Android’s notifications.</p>

<h4 id="imessage">iMessage</h4>

<p>I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about
“solving” mobile chat<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it’s been solved for them for years. iMessage is the
gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the guilty urge to nudge friends
towards iPhone so I can use it with them.</p>

<p>In classic Apple fashion iMessages aren’t between Apple accounts, but devices.
I recently changed my email address but I need to keep my old one in my Apple
account indefinitely so my friends’ threads with me won’t retroactively split
into two.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iMessage include automatically entering SMS 2FA codes on
any device.</p>

<h4 id="watch">Moto 360 → Apple Watch</h4>

<p>My relationship with the Moto 360 was on and off. To me it served two
functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let me check the time without taking out my phone</li>
<li>Let me check a notification without taking out my phone</li>
</ul>

<p>These were helpful functions, but the work of managing an extra battery to
charge and an extra device to put on and take off made me fluctuate every six
months or so between wearing it every day and not wearing it at all.</p>

<p>Apple Watch adds enough bullet points that I've had no such fluctuations<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I
wear it daily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlock macOS/iOS when nearby, in lieu of entering a password/passcode</li>
<li>Vibrate in patterns for Apple Maps navigation directions (e.g. one pattern
for upcoming left, another for upcoming right)</li>
<li>Pay using Apple Pay by tapping</li>
<li>Shazam a song without taking out your phone</li>
<li>Show popped reminders or upcoming calendar events on the watch face</li>
<li>Control Keynote presentations (e.g. tap for next slide)</li>
<li>View your phone's camera viewfinder live and tap to snap (e.g. for group
photos)</li>
<li>Control media playback</li>
<li>"Walkie-talkie" with a close friend</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the above, the third-party app ecosystem plays ball with Apple
Watch a lot more than the Android app ecosystem does with Wear OS.</p>

<h3 id="appletv">Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV</h3>

<p>We don’t have HomePods and my spouse forbids me to get any after filling our
home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey Google,
play <code>$SHOW</code>”.</p>

<h4 id="remote">The Remote</h4>

<p>Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that it's
pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use;
I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Otherwise it has a good build quality and feels good in the hand. But it’s a
remote and can be lost. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that attaches to the
coffee table. I miss the remote-free life.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is selected on
the Apple TV, a notification shows on my iOS devices allowing me to use them
as a keyboard. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for
invoking 1Password to fill logins.</p>

<h3 id="home">Google Home → Apple Home</h3>

<p>My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent building up
our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a Raspberry Pi made it all
work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV showing our Nest doorbell camera
picture-in-picture when the doorbell rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a
Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home Hub.)</p>

<p>The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list that
feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a breeze.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT gateway,
having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center pull-down menus, and
hooking up more devices through automation with Shortcuts.</p>

<h3 id="airpods">Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro</h3>

<p>Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true.
Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my
ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between devices based
on attention, and Siri integration slightly worse than Pixel Buds's Google
Assistant imtegration.</p>

<h3 id="mail">Gmail → iCloud Mail</h3>

<p>The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I control
anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.</p>

<h4 id="migrating">Migrating</h4>

<p>I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the experience
was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired result. After
starting from scratch several times and hitting new issues every time, I’ve
chosen to live the life of searching in two places when I need something.</p>

<p>To migrate, I coopted ben@twos.dev from Google Workspace which I had only used
for a little consulting. This caused a few minor issues and UX hiccups because
Workspace Gmail behaved as if it were still my provider, but DNS wasn't
delivering it anything.</p>

<p>I wanted my main Google account to match my main email address, so I tried to
use this Google Workspace account as my new primary Google account. But many
Google features don't support Workspace accounts, like Google One, family
sharing, some security features, and (for better and worse) some types of data
harvesting and therefore ad targeting.</p>

<p>So, I tried sticking with my classic Google account and accepting that its
email would always be different from my preferred email. I finally snagged my
leg on Google Groups, as Groups does not recognize alternative email addresses
on Google accounts; I was forced to be presented as my old email address.
(Though I did not test if posting via email from ben@twos.dev worked.)</p>

<p>I've now landed on creating a new personal Google account with ben@twos.dev as
its primary email address. I needed to delete the twos.dev Google Workspace
organization to do this, as it had claim to ben@twos.dev already. Signing up
to Google without an @gmail.com address is a somewhat hidden option when
signing up for Google. Beware that you can later "upgrade" to an @gmail.com
account, but you can never change back.</p>

<h4 id="daily">Daily Use</h4>

<p>The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve installed
Thunderbird to get by.</p>

<p>Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and has a
solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability issues:</p>

<p>Mail's junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk folder,
even after months of correcting it.</p>

<p>When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud Drive links
instead, but I've had recipients experience trouble downloading them.</p>

<p>Mail's search is bad. On macOS, it searches only the mailbox being viewed
(e.g. Inbox) by default. Because I do inbox zero, this is never what I want to
search. (iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by default.) When you are
done searching and click Inbox to "return home" the search field doesn't
clear, leading you to believe your Inbox is empty.</p>

<p>Ignoring that, Gmail still wins search by an order of magnitude. For example,
Gmail searches the contents of PDFs attached to emails; I’ve found this
invaluable finding old leases and whatnot.</p>

<p>Mail is okay at displaying emails as conversations. Once in a while, it omits
something it shouldn’t. When I click Send while replying to a thread it
doesn't immediately append my message, causing me to believe something went
wrong. I experience long, uncollapsible nested quotes in some emails, where
Gmail was always good at collapsing them automatically.</p>

<p>macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service has a
separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have disparate
feature sets and don't synchronize. iOS Mail does not support filters. I’ve
opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because the iCloud filters can only
check one condition per filter, and I just have my iMac stay awake 24/7.</p>

<p>macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to archive.
Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for any app.</p>

</p>

<p>If you want a Mail-like experience with Gmail as a backend, instead of using
SMTP I recommend <a href="https://mimestream.com">Mimestream</a>; it is written by a former
Apple engineer on Mail to have a similar UX but using proper Gmail APIs.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in Spotlight
and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.</p>

<h3 id="calendar">Google Calendar → Apple Calendar</h3>

<p>This may be the first service I switch back to Google. Google Calendar is so
ubiquitous that I've forgotten how limited and finicky calendar protocols are
at their core. So many things just stop working when you leave Google
Calendar, all the way down to RSVPs.</p>

<p>I don't recommend using the Week view in Calendar. Like Google Calendar, Apple
Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to represent the current time of day; but
this bar extends 100% of the width of the week, and does not do a good job
showing you which day today is.</p>

<p><figure style="text-align: center">
  
  <picture>
    <source srcset="img/apple-calendar-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
    <img
      alt="A screenshot of Calendar.app on macOS showing a week with a red line across it."

    />
  </picture>
  
  <figcaption>Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it is?</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing panic
about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar only shows
when viewing today.</p>

<p>Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say they
appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a calendar invitation
there are two attachments, <code>invite.ics</code> and <code>mime-attachment.ics</code>. Each will pop
up a Calendar float to add the event; I’ve learned to use <code>mime-attachment.ics</code>
because it seems to open a two-way connection with the sender’s event, where
<code>invite.ics</code> seems to be a local copy.</p>

</video>

  <figcaption>Opening a Google Calendar invitation from within the Apple ecosystem.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>Google Calendar is the stickiest part of the Google ecosystem due to the
features they’ve built on top of vanilla calendaring and their ubiquity.
Interactions with Google Calendar users, which in my experience is everyone,
always leave me with a feeling of unease: “did they get this RSVP?” or “did
their event update with the new time?”. For some use cases, Calendar will RSVP
by sending an email from your account with a plaintext description of your
response. I haven’t discovered yet if these are seen by human eyes or
interpreted automatically.</p>

<p>Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed to have
a refresh in a decade. Calendar can automatically generate “travel to” and
“travel from” events based on the travel time between locations.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps and Siri suggestions
for navigation destinations and video call links.</p>

<h3 id="maps">Google Maps → Apple Maps</h3>

<p>Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly so. But
that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s only gotten good, not great. There are UX benefits over
Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past this light, then at the next
one, turn <code>$DIRECTION</code>”, but about 5% of my trips to new places end me at the
right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been routed to the delivery
entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an airport, and the wrong parking
lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) of a large shopping center.</p>

<p>I’m continuing to give it chances because I know more data helps, but for
tight schedules I go back to Google Maps.</p>

<p>Then there's the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos, menus,
ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here; their purchase
of Yelp means they inherit photos &amp; reviews, but even that can't beat the
sheer volume Google Maps. I've only seen one or two restaurants with ordering
functionality enabled.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and Calendar,
Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other sources, and Apple
Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming turns.</p>

<h4 id="findmy">Location Sharing → Find My</h4>

<p>I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends and
family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple offering (a
separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one would be happy with
the other.</p>

<p>I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must launch
with intention, but it's a wash for me<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I've had serendipitous encounters
enabled by seeing a friend is close by in Google Maps accidentally.</p>

<p>AirTags and device tracking are the big Apple killer feature here, which work
as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one in my bag just to
have peace of mind. The app sends a notification when I leave <code>$DEVICE</code> at
<code>$LOCATION</code>, with easy controls to disable future notifications for any such
combination.</p>

<h3 id="photos">Google Photos → Apple Photos</h3>

<p>Mostly, these two products are equivalent. Apple Photos has more powerful
editing tools but Google Photos has more powerful search. Both have similar
tooling around memories, viewing photos on maps or by year, etc.</p>

<p>Classically, Google has a better web experience and Apple has a better native
experience, meaning sharing photos with others is better if and only if you're
sharing with other iOS users.</p>

<p>The migration was simple, but long. Google Takeout produced hundreds of
gigabytes of exports, which I downloaded onto a Mac and then imported with
Photos.app. Due to Apple's offline-first approach synchronization took place
in the background at reduced speeds. This meant it tried to take place while the
laptop was closed and charging (even if Photos.app wasn't open). This was
jarring at first when trying to babysit the process, as by design it stops
performing well when you start using the machine. When I learned to let go, it
showed its colors.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects include unified conversations: when you share content from
Google Photos with someone, you and they can comment on photos and albums; when
you share content from Apple Photos using Messages, the photos appear inline in
Messages. If you want to "comment" on one, you simply Reply to that message.</p>

<h3 id="safari">Chrome → Safari</h3>

<p>This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from
bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.</p>

<p>In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the Chrome
chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone applications even
when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go backward or forward slides
the page on/off screen allowing you to peek without navigating, but it
backfires and feels artificial for low-travel anchor links and some
single-page app transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the
navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can't
identify.</p>

<p>When it works it's beautiful and useful, but when it doesn't it's jarring.</p>

<p><figure style="text-align: center">

  <figcaption>Navigating through history in Safari with swipe gestures.</figcaption>

</p>

<p>I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced some
webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others (local only); Meet also supports
more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one tab.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff (move a browsing session between
devices smoothly) and the downright bonkers power efficiency of Safari on macOS.</p>

<h4 id="keychain">iCloud Keychain</h4>

<p>While moving to Safari, I replaced 1Password with iCloud Keychain. It serves
basic needs, but that’s it. It can store a username, a password, a 2FA code,
and a domain name for each entry.</p>

<p>It cannot store two domains for one entry, e.g. gmail.com and google.com. It
cannot store arbitrary notes on an entry, e.g. the PIN that T-Mobile customer
service agents ask for. It cannot name an entry, e.g. Washington Corporations
and Charities System instead of ccfs.sos.wa.gov. It cannot store non-login
entries like documents, ID numbers, or insurance information.</p>

<p>Using the 2FA field involves manual effort. Scanning rarely works, so I enter
the 2FA secret by copying and pasting the code. Some sites provide a raw code,
while others wrap the code in a URL that contains other metadata. 1Password
accepts either, but iCloud Keychain assumes you hand it a code; if you hand it
a URL it will silently accept it but produce incorrect codes.</p>

<p>I moved back to 1Password.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include faster and more fluid autofill
support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS.</p>

<h3 id="numbers">Google Sheets → Numbers</h3>

<p>As a casual spreadsheets user, Sheets and Numbers are nearly identical.
Numbers has nicer UX when editing formulae that visualizes cell(s) being
referenced. It tries to humanize references, e.g. “Ben age” for a cell in a
row with header “Ben” and a column with header “Age”, instead of A:123. This
is nice until headers get long and multiworded. Overall it’s a wash.</p>

<h3 id="pages">Google Docs → Pages</h3>

<p>(To be filled in; I have not had much Pages experience.)</p>

<h3 id="notes">Keep → Notes</h3>

<p>I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>get out of my way and let me
write, then let me deal with it later. Keep supplies that. Its layout is hard to
browse, but it makes up for it with great search.</p>

<p>Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on
shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform, with roughly the same
text formatting options as Markdown (unfortunately without the markup).
Instead of adding several notes to a category or color in Keep, I append to an
existing note that contains several thoughts. This keeps the number of notes
down, which makes categorization more reasonable, which improves browsing.</p>

<p>For me, it’s a wash between the two.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts and cross-app drag-and-drop. I
use a shortcut to create a new note titled and sorted correctly before
starting a Chinese lesson.</p>

<h3 id="reminders">Tasks → Reminders</h3>

<p>Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS. Reminders can be scheduled
to “pop” at a date, a date and time, a location, and/or when messaging
<code>$PERSON</code>. Reminders can belong to lists (e.g. work vs. personal), lists can be
shared (e.g. family chores), and reminders within shared lists can be assigned
to people.</p>

<p>Reminders have a name, description, URL field, and priority (higher priority
reminders are sorted higher and given special UI treatment). Reminders can
have images attached to them, and any number of subtasks. They can be tagged
and flagged.</p>

<p>It’s a powerful app, but everything is presented simply. There is a native
macOS app that synchronizes, so I get proper notifications on most of my
devices. In app, I use the “Today” view which shows reminders ready to be
addressed.</p>

<p>As one use case, my spouse and I share a family reminders list. On that list,
a reminder to take out the trash pops every trash day when I arrive home. It’s
assigned to me, but if she happens to do it before I get home she can check it
off; it then won't pop for me.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share sheet in
native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in the URL field)
and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder (if any) on my Apple
Watch homescreen.</p>

<h3 id="siri">Google Assistant → Siri</h3>

<p>Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can't answer questions
like "What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?" or "Who played Alan in
Tron Legacy?".</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Siri include surface-level interaction with native apps:
setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home devices, etc.</p>

<h3 id="shortcuts">Google Assistant Routines → Shortcuts</h3>

<p>I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most
power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had
around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it to shell
scripts.</p>

<p><figure style="text-align: center">
  
  <picture>

    />
  </picture>
  
  <figcaption>I use Shortcuts.app to block times on my work calendar based on personal events.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>As one example, I like to write in an app called iA Writer. I use Shortcuts to
automatically commit and push my writing to this website daily. Because iA
Writer stores files in iCloud, and another app called Working Copy can
interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Working Copy) Pull from <code>twos.dev</code> remote</li>
<li>(iOS) Get contents of folder <code>iCloud/iA Writer/Published</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Write contents of folder to <code>./src</code> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Stage <code>./src</code> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Commit <code>twos.dev</code> with message “Automatic commit by iA Writer
sync job”</li>
<li>(Working Copy) Push <code>twos.dev</code> to remote</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could
do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say that my phone is
a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="drive">Google Drive → iCloud Drive</h3>

<p>Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception. Use it
if you're in the Apple ecosystem, and don't if you're not. The biggest downside
I've witnessed is that iCloud Drive does not have an API. This is not a problem
when running software on a persistent macOS or Windows machine, but for Linux or
for ephemeral machines (e.g. CI) the only option is an unofficial
reverse-engineered solution.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow between
your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for first-party and
some third-party apps to use it as a default data store anyway (e.g. Pages
saves documents there, Numbers saves spreadsheets there).</p>

<p>macOS also pulls a trick where it allows you to queue up actions on iCloud
Drive files that haven't yet fully synced to your machine yet. For example, if
you download an image to iCloud Drive on your iPhone, it will show up
~immediately on macOS Finder, then begin syncing. If you try to open the file
on macOS before it finishes, the open action will queue until the sync
finishes, then execute. This behavior is nice most of the time (compared to
the industry standard of trying to open a broken file), but when you first
encounter it with a large file like a video it's easy to perceive it as
slowness or stalling.</p>

<h3 id="music">YouTube Music → Apple Music</h3>

<p>Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:
services.</p>

<p>Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified a lot
of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator workflow that
would move the cursor to my existing library, select and copy a title, then
move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and add the top result.</p>

<p>The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with the
iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app. Navigation is
slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact that it takes too many
transitions to get where you’re going. For details on its UX failings, see (Jake
from Cinnamon's
post)[<a href="https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem">https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem</a>].</p>

<p>I miss Google Play Music.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration and better
Siri support for when I’m driving and want to play something.</p>

<h3 id="pay">Google Pay → Apple Pay</h3>

<p>I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me embarrassed to use
it. It was hard to find "the spot" on credit card machines to tap. Apple Pay
feels more spatially generous; once I start hunting for the spot, it's already
been found. It could be because the iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of
the device while Pixels have them in the middle, or maybe the world has just
gotten better at this since then. I'm now using Apple Pay every chance I get.</p>

<p>The apparent meta for credit card companies in the US is to give customers
either 1.5% cash back on everything, or 1% back on everything and 2-5% back on
specific categories.</p>

<p>The Apple Card gives 2% back on everything purchased through Apple Pay and 1%
on everything else, which is the best deal I've seen. (There are also some
merchants that do 3%, but I'm not about tracking and optimizing that.) Of the
purchases I make in Seattle, about 80% of shops and restaurants who do
pay-at-counter support Apple Pay, and about 20% of table-service restaurants
do. For online orders, roughly half of the non-Amazon orders I place support
it.</p>

<p>The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first credit
card experience that feels like it was made this century. The app is
beautiful, snappy, and simple.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a living document.</p>

<p>Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the sum of
its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned is that it’s
the long tail of ecosystem benefits that makes up most of that excess. Not the
two or three things per product I’ve mentioned above, but the dozens that
happen without me noticing that add up to make a more enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are functional
benefits to working in a clean space<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it’s easier to find things, spilling a
liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less dust<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>but the bulk of the
benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways the space feels better and motivates
more.</p>

<p>As of 2022 May, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would not count
it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell and I'll continue
to document my journey here.</p>
