<p>Thanks to some <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@glacials/111304805719662198" target="_blank">helpful feedback</a>,
I've decided to migrate from having several ever-changing "living documents" on twos.dev
to making yearly posts with updates to each buffered and then released all at once.</p>

<p>This way, you'll know when you read the post that a lot has likely changed since last time you did.
With living documents changes were fast and frequent,
providing theoretically more up-to-date information but never actually getting put in front of the same pair of eyeballs twice.</p>

<p>This post is the maiden voyage for my "little life-changers",
which are what I call products, product categories, or habits that have affected me positively <em>forever</em>.
Because of that, a product that fits this description will never drop from this list.
I've marked the ones that have met this criterion,
and the ones that are new for this year.</p>

<h2>5.11 Belt</h2>

<p><em>Veteran since the "living document"</em>.</p>

<p>I wear a belt every day.
I used to buy a new one every 1<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2 years,
then I got <a href="https://amzn.to/3ptyErI" target="_blank">this belt</a>.</p>

<p>That was TODO years ago.
I have worn it &gt; 95% of days since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear.
I expect I will never buy another belt.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3ptyErI" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://www.511tactical.com/tdu-belt-15-plastic-buckle.html" target="_blank">5.11</a></p>

<h2>Micro Four Thirds</h2>

<p><em>Veteran since the "living document"</em>.</p>

<p>For photography folks.</p>

<p>Micro Four Thirds is a camera and lens conector.
Unlike most proprietary systems,
it's an open standard with many companies participating.
The de facto flagships are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.</p>

<p>Its biggest advantage is its high <code>photo quality : gear size</code> ratio.
My archenemy is not having my camera with me;
every time I have to settle for my phone camera I question having a camera at all.</p>

<p>Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can fit my setup in ~half the space as before.
That means a full-day setup in a 20L backpack,
a camera + couple lenses in a 6L sling,
or a camera + lens in a 2L chest pouch.</p>

<p>I'm using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III
(<a href="https://amzn.to/3PtUO81" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii" target="_blank">OM System</a>).
My everyday versatile lens is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3FxQYEP" target="_blank">Olympus M.Zuiko 14<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>150mm F4.0<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>5.6</a>.</p>

<h2>A Long, Mountable Power Strip</h2>

<p><em>Veteran since the "living document"</em>.</p>

<p>Mounting a hilariously long power strip under every desk in my house,
paired with <a href="https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa" target="_blank">any cheap</a> cable basket,
has given me the best and easiest cable management I've ever had.</p>

<p>It's important to overbudget your outlets by ~2x and to go long, not fat,
so cables can plug in where they are instead of playing musical chairs with a rat's nest of wall warts.</p>

<p>Any will do, but I use these: <a href="https://amzn.to/44e4c3W" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://kungfukingsocket.com/products/power-strip-6" target="_blank">KungFuKingSocket</a></p>

<h2>Noctua Fans</h2>

<p><em>Veteran since the "living document"</em>.</p>

<p>As a <a href="autism.html">noise-sensitive</a> person whose hobbies involve computers,
silence is important to me in a gaming machine.
Noctua makes giant, silent, brown fans. That's it.</p>

<p>Once I got one I could never switch back.
My build is centered around their obnoxiously large <a href="https://amzn.to/3pyrIJU" target="_blank">fanned heatsink</a>,
and has been purring for six years.
I expect to reuse the same fans for my next build, whenever it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3LR2Y7J" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Jetz Scrubz Sponges</h2>

<p><em>Veteran since the "living document"</em>.</p>

<p>These kitchen sponges are easily a 10x<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>100x improvement over the traditional sponges,
in all of these categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lifespan before getting damaged</li>
<li>Lifespan before getting permanently gross</li>
<li>Tendancy to get temporarily gross</li>
<li>Ease of cleaning once temporarily gross</li>
</ul>

<p>They're pricier upfront, but cheaper long-term.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/46nSjKq" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bidets</h2>

<p><em>Veteran since the "living document"</em>.</p>

<p>If someone came up to you in the street and smeared poop all over you,
would you wipe it off with a paper towel, or would you take a shower?</p>

<p>Before I tried one, I had three fundamental misunderstandings about bidets:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bidets are separate from toilets.</li>
<li>Bidets are expensive.</li>
<li>It's a big deal to install a bidet.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>None of these is true.</strong>
It takes about 15 minutes to install a bidet onto your toilet,
and you can get one for <a href="https://amzn.to/3McRz2a" target="_blank">under fifty bucks</a>.
It's just a piece of plastic that goes between the toilet and the seat.
You do not need to put your hands inside the toilet bowl to install it.</p>

<p>Bidets pay for themselves in unused toilet paper.
I use between 1<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>10% of the toilet paper I used before.
Its only function now is drying.</p>

<p>Bidets feel weird for about 10 seconds, then never again.
It's honestly disgusting <em>not</em> to use one now.</p>

<p>Buy whichever one makes you try it, but here are some options:</p>

<ul>
<li>($) <a href="https://amzn.to/3McRz2a" target="_blank">Attachment</a>:
Simple, replaces nothing about your toilet, sprays cold water only.
I promise it doesn't feel like a cold shower.
That area of your body doesn't experience temperature the same.</li>
<li>($$) <a href="https://amzn.to/3PYqFwc" target="_blank">Seat</a>:
The weight distribution of my seat got worse with just an attachment,
so a combination seat/bidet is something to consider if that bugs you.
Otherwise, the functions are ~the same as the attachment.</li>
<li>($$$) <a href="https://amzn.to/3S9PBn9" target="_blank">Air Dry</a>;
Seats that plug in jump in price and feature set drastically,
but I think air dry is the only big one to consider.
Warm water is overrated.
If you're not sure if you need a heated seat, you don't.</li>
</ul>

<h1>In Search Of</h1>

<p>I'm in search of a life-changing product for these categories.
If you have a lead on any, please let me know on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@glacials" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>.</p>

<h2>Water Bottle</h2>

<p>I am in search of a reusable water bottle with the following qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can last 10+ years</li>
<li>Can last a week of no washing without getting funky</li>
<li>Is less than ~9cm in diameter (i.e. a comfortable size for a Peak Design Everyday
Backpack V1 20L cup holder)</li>
<li>Holds about 1L</li>
<li>Attached or attachable lid</li>
<li>Ability to stay cold ~1 day preferred</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest I ever came was the <a href="https://amzn.to/42XJaoR" target="_blank">Thermos Element 5 32 oz</a>, but
I lost mine and the product has since discontinued.</p>

<h2>Hair Trimmer</h2>

<p>I am in search of a combination beard and head trimmer with these qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can last 3+ years</li>
<li>USB-C chargeable</li>
<li>Has two or fewer attachments, or a good organization system for attachments</li>
<li>Can trim beards in the 1~6mm range</li>
<li>Can trim head hair in the 1~3cm range</li>
<li>Requires no more than two passes for reasonable coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest I've found in my research is the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3rFxMBB" target="_blank">MANSCAPED Beard Hedger</a>,
but it seems to need five or more passes for good coverage.</p>
