  <h2>Job history</h2>
  My jobs don't define me, but understanding what I'm willing to do for 40 hours a week helps understand me.
  <ul>
    <li>YourBase (2020 - present)
      <ul>
        <li>Senior Software Engineer</li>
        <li>I was #5 at YourBase. I work mostly on our Python acceleration.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Splits.io (2019 - 2020)
      <ul>
        <li>Founder & CEO</li>
        <li>
          Splits.io was a side project of mine that grew too big to stay one. I
          took one year "off" to work on it full-time and make it pay for
          itself. I learned a lot of skills as a founder that have made me a far
          better engineer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Twitch (2014-2019)
      <ul>
        <li>Senior Software Engineer</li>
        <li>
          I was #91 at Twitch (YC07) and left at 1700 employees. I built
          formational products that eventually led to its $1B acquisition. I
          mentored, taught classes, built i18n, scaled chat, and wrote its first
          spam filter (still in use). On the side I ran
          <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/93570710">panels</a>
          and built <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/720689621466619904">features</a>
          I wanted for myself.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (2010 - 2013 (summers))
      <ul>
        <li>Software Engineering Intern</li>
        <li>
          I built on <a href="https://github.com/esgf">open source tools</a> for
          the climate science community.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Boswell's Discount Party Supplies (2006 - 2012)
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some of the best lessons I've learned in life are from working a
          shitty retail job. I recommend everyone do it once.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
