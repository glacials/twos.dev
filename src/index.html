  <h1>Ben Carlsson</h1>
  I'm a Senior Software Engineer in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, WA. I work remotely full time.
  <p>I've worked on everything from social networks to authentication-as-a-service.</p>

  <p>I speak English and a little Chinese. (我会说英文，也会说一点中文。)</p>

  <h2>Job history</h2>
  My jobs don't define me, but understanding what I'm willing to do for 40 hours a week helps understand me.
  <ul>
    <li>YourBase
      <ul>
        <li>2020 - present</li>
        <li>Senior Software Engineer</li>
        <li>I was #5 at YourBase. I work mostly on our Python acceleration.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Splits.io
      <ul>
        <li>2019 - 2020</li>
        <li>Founder & CEO</li>
        <li>
          I'd started Splits.io as a side project in 2013. It grew to 10k MAU on its own but was sucking money out of
          my wallet to stay online, so I decided to take a year
          to work on it full-time. I learned a lot of skills as a founder that have made me a far better engineer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Twitch
      <ul>
        <li>2014-2019</li>
        <li>Senior Software Engineer</li>
        <li>
          I was #91 at Twitch (YC07) and left at 1700 employees. I built many formational products that eventually led
          to its $1B acquisition by Amazon. I also mentored engineers, built and taught the internal Go class, rewrote
          how the company does i18n, scaled the chat system, and wrote the first spam filter on Twitch (still in use).
          On the side I ran some <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/93570710">panels</a> and
          <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/720689621466619904">built features I wanted for myself</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
      <ul>
        <li>2010 - 2013 (summers)</li>
        <li>Software Engineering Intern</li>
        <li>
          I worked on <a href="https://github.com/esgf">open source climate tools</a> for the scientific community.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Boswell's Discount Party Supplies
      <ul>
        <li>2006 - 2012</li>
        <li>
          Some of the best lessons I've learned in life are from working a shitty retail job. I recommend
          everyone do it at least once.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  society UPE, but to be honest it wasn't really my thing.
