# User Guide

This page describes things I value at work. This is descriptive, not prescriptive; try to treat this as a set of FYIs, not a set of requirements. Use or ignore at your discretion, and share your own guide with me!

## Communication Style

1. **Succinctness**: The more people who will read what you're writing, the higher the cost/benefit of spending more time writing it. (For widespread pieces, my "writing time" is 90% editing.) [More](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html), [even more](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)
2. **Agree on a vision**: Coordination is slow. Once we agree on a shared vision, it's easier for everyone if we trust (and authorize) each other to make the right decisions in motion.
3. **Async, by default**: A thirty-second interruption can set me back 30 minutes. I like to bring more conversations async: tickets, pull requests, recordings. [More](https://heeris.id.au/trinkets/ProgrammerInterrupted.png)
4. **Tickets, by default**: As a forgetful person I love single-origin paper trails.
5. **Speak in customer problems**: Even if a solution "feels right" be prepared for me to ask what customer problem it solves. The one free pass is tech debt, since we all know how it impacts customers.
6. **Know when to meet**: Async communication has its limits [2]. If things are getting heated, misunderstood, or blocked, throw a meeting on my calendar or [pop in](thepopin.html).
7. **Give unprompted feedback**: I love feedback. We all feel it's awkward to give feedback and I think that is dumb and you should help me break that norm.

## Warnings

- **My brain is backburners.** I can't immediately answer complex questions. I can temporarily get past this by asking a flurry of questions. This means I'm excited about the problem, but sometimes stresses people out; see #7 above :)
- **I go rogue.** Sometimes I care about fixing or building something that I'll do it without tracking it, because the overhead is bigger than the job itself. [Loved features](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglcls%2Fstatus%2F720689621466619904&src=typed_query) have come out of having the freedom to do this; see #2 above :)
- **I work weird hours.** Motivation strikes me randomly. Sometimes that's during a workday but sometimes it's on a Sunday or at 4 AM or for 16 hours straight. To counterbalance, I shorten my workdays and the math roughly works out. If you see emails or commits from me with unhealthy-feeling timestamps, keep in mind my default workday is at ~70% capacity.
