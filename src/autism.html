  <h1>Invisible Autism</h1>

  <p>February 2022</p>

    <i>
      This is a more complete version of a
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29686395">comment</a> I left on
      Hacker News. I recommend reading the subject article by C.L. Lynch,
      <a href="https://neuroclastic.com/its-a-spectrum-doesnt-mean-what-you-think/">
      <i>"Autism is a spectrum" doesn't mean what you think</i></a>.
    </i>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical. I
    have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and
    fighting climate change. I don't need support from others on a daily basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet my shrink, a 30-year clinical psychologist and behavioral health department
    director, wrote it right there on my medical chart:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Autism spectrum disorder
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Behind the scenes, there's a "me" hardly anyone sees. It's the me that you can
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29690399">paralyze</a> with a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/1273051092960440320">text message</a>,
    whose entire day is ruined if I brush my teeth <em>after</em> showering instead of
    before, and whose arm feels on fire if you lightly draw little circles on it with
    your finger. It's the me that was mute for nine years.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not an outlier. In fact, 2% of the world has autism [1]. You've met several
    people with autism without realizing it. Is that a surprise to you?
  </p>
  <h2>The Infamous Spectrum</h2>
  <p>
    We've all heard "autism is a spectrum". But that word, "spectrum", in that context,
    has had its meaning lost to time. A spectrum is not a scale. This is a spectrum:
  </p>
  <p><center><div class="spectrum">&nbsp;</div></center></p>
  <p>
    There is no "more" or "less"; no "high" or "low". There is only "different".
  </p>
  <p>
    Every neurodivergence has shitty parts about "coming out", but autism seems to have
    a uniquely high rate of responses along the lines of "I don't believe you" or "Are
    you sure?" or "You don't <em>seem</em> autistic".
  </p>
  <p>
    People believe autism looks like X so strongly that if they don't see X, they won't
    even believe a professional diagnosis. Why? What is X?
  <h2>The Canary Symptom</h2>
  <p>
    Autism is a grab bag of symptoms, and not all people with autism are dealt the same
    hand. One of the possible symptoms is
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">
    <p>
      Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships, ranging,
      for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts;
      to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of
      interest in peers.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">DSM-5</a>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We'll come back to that in a bit.
  </p>
  <h3>A Personal Example</h3>
  <p>
    One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As cool as
    it sounds, this is no superpower. My body's defense systems will sometimes
    malfunction and incorrectly believe everything is far too loud.
  </p>
  <p>
    During one of these bouts, all the neurological safety mechanisms of an air horn
    being blown point-blank into your ear activate in response to things as quiet as a
    book page turning: startle, flinching, irritability, inability to think, inability
    to carry on a conversation. Just you know, the all-around feeling of "losing it".
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine going to the grocery store and at any given moment dozens of people are
    point-blank blowing air horns into your ears. Maybe you'll understand me then, when
    I say that as a kid I would sometimes collapse to the floor and roll around
    screaming with my hands against my ears, begging to go home.
  </p>
  <p>
    But! I'm one of the lucky ones. I didn't get dealt the "difficulties adjusting
    behavior to suit various social contexts" symptom (above). So when other people in
    the grocery store look at me like I'm losing it (reminder: I am) I can log that
    detail away for next time, and try a little harder to keep it in. I've gone through
    several stages over 30+ years:
    <ol>
      <li>Rolling on the floor screaming</li>
      <li>Covering my ears with my palms and closing my eyes as hard as I could</li>
      <li>Sitting down in the aisle quietly and trying to tune everything out</li>
      <li>Subtly putting my fingers in my ears and screaming interally</li>
      <li>Preventatively, inventing excuses to stay home</li>
      <li>(all grown up) Leaving</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same. Inside,
    I'm still that kid rolling on the floor screaming. The only difference is that I
    have learned to fake not being him.
  </p>
  <h3>Play the Hand You're Dealt</h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, people dealt the "difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various
    social contexts" card get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This,
    perhaps, is what the world thinks autism "looks like".
  </p>
  <p>
    People who can't act the pain away often need more support because our world is a
    social world. But they are not any more "low-functioning" than I am
    "high-functioning". Those words are descriptions of how <em>observers</em>
    experience our autism, not how we do. This is why they have fallen out of use since
    the DSM-5.
  </p>
  <h2>Masking</h2>
  <p>
    In the autism community we call the ability to fake not having autism
    <b>masking</b>. Those of us who can do it, do it ~every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Masking a hearing hypersensitivity is just one example. Autism can come with any
    sensory hypersensitivity, and any of several other symptoms. For many, you can find
    some great masking advice in online communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other symptoms people may mask are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Stimming" (e.g. rocking or hand flapping; a positive behavior), by holding it in until alone
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduced or no showing of emotion via facial expressions, by studying and emulating others
      </li>
      <li>
        Inability to cope with ambiguity, by overplanning on what is controllable
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Masking comes with its own set of issues [2], particularly that it's enourmously
    exhausting; it feels like all the power-hungry problem-solving brainpower is being
    used to emulate what many would just call "social common sense". For me personally,
    this means less brainpower to actually problem solve&mdash;I am literally dumber
    when I am with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people with autism agree that the best part of the day is the first moment
    alone when you can finally "unmask". But for all its downsides, masking is a great
    tool and being able to use it is a blessing.
  </p>
  <h2>A Different Way to Think About Autism</h2>
  <p>
    2% of the world has autism. I didn't find out I had it until I was 30 years old, and
    it explained so much about my life. The diagnosis served as a starting point for
    personal research, led me to a community of autism "study buddies", and has even
    landed me on some meds to help with the worst parts. My relationships and personal
    happiness have dramatically improved. I can't help but wonder how much earlier this
    all could have started if I hadn't been so disincentivized from expressing how I
    felt at my worst moments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Encourage yourself and others to feel comfortable talking with family, friends, and
    doctors about ways you might feel different from others. It's a hard thing, to know
    if your brain is doing something different from other people's brains&mdash;to try
    to reach a conclusion with a sample size of 1 and no control.
  </p>
  <p>
    If someone talks to you about it, be open to the idea that they might be
    onto something, instead of dismissing it as a character weakness to be overcome like
    so many people in my life did.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, the best thing I got out of it was just knowing what was wrong.
