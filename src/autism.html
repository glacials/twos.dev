  <h1>Invisible Autism</h1>

  <p>February 2022</p>

  <p>
    <i>
      This is a more complete version of a
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29686395">comment</a> I left on
      HN. I recommend reading the subject article by C.L. Lynch,
      <a href="https://neuroclastic.com/its-a-spectrum-doesnt-mean-what-you-think/">
      <i>"Autism is a spectrum" doesn't mean what you think</i></a>.
    </i>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical. I
    have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and
    fighting climate change. I don't need support from others on a daily basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet my shrink, a 30-year clinical psychologist and behavioral health department
    director, wrote it right there on my medical chart:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Autism spectrum disorder
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Behind the scenes, there's a "me" hardly anyone sees. It's the me you can
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29690399">paralyze</a> with a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/1273051092960440320">text message</a>,
    whose entire day is ruined if I brush my teeth <em>after</em> showering instead of
    before, and whose arm feels on fire if you lightly draw little circles on it with
    your finger. It's the me that was mute for nine years growing up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not an outlier. In fact, 2% of the world has autism [1]. Is that a surprise to
    you? Do you even believe me?
  </p>
  <h2>The Infamous Spectrum</h2>
  <p>
    We've all heard "autism is a spectrum". But that word, "spectrum", has had its
    original meaning lost to time. A spectrum is not a scale. This is a spectrum:
  </p>
  <p><center><div class="spectrum">&nbsp;</div></center></p>
  <p>
    There is no "more" or "less"; no "high" or "low". There is only "different".
  </p>
  <p>
    But clearly, something is going on here. Every type of neurodivergence has its
    shitty parts about "coming out", but autism seems to have a uniquely high rate of
    responses along the lines of "I don't believe you".
  </p>
  <p>
    People believe autism looks like X so strongly that if they don't see X, they won't
    even believe a professional diagnosis. Why? What is X?
  <h2>The Canary Symptom</h2>
  <p>
    Autism is a grab bag of symptoms, and not all people with autism are dealt the same
    hand. One of the possible symptoms is the following:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">
    <p>
      Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships, ranging,
      for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts;
      to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of
      interest in peers.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">DSM-5</a>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Let's let that stew for a moment and take a brief detour.
  </p>
  <h3>A Personal Example</h3>
  <p>
    One symptom I got dealt is a hearing hypersensitivity. As cool as it sounds, this is
    no superpower. Instead, my body's defense systems will sometimes malfunction and
    incorrectly believe everything is far too loud.
  </p>
  <p>
    During one of these bouts, all the neurological safety mechanisms of an air horn
    being blown point-blank into my ear will activate in response to things as quiet as
    a book page turning: startle, flinching, irritability, inability to think, inability
    to carry on a conversation. Just you know, the all-around feeling of "losing it".
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine going to the grocery store and at any given moment dozens of people are
    point-blank blowing air horns into your ears. Maybe you'll understand me then, when
    I say that as a kid I would sometimes collapse to the floor and roll around
    screaming with my hands against my ears, begging to go home.
  </p>
  <p>
    But! I'm one of the lucky ones. I didn't get dealt the "difficulties adjusting
    behavior to suit various social contexts" symptom. So when other people in the
    grocery store look at me like I'm losing it (reminder: I am) I can log that detail
    away for next time, and try a little harder to keep it in. I've gone through several
    stages over 30+ years:
    <ol>
      <li>Rolling on the floor screaming</li>
      <li>Covering my ears with my palms and closing my eyes as hard as I could</li>
      <li>Sitting down in the aisle quietly and trying to tune everything out</li>
      <li>Subtly putting my fingers in my ears and screaming interally</li>
      <li>Inventing excuses to stay home</li>
      <li>(all grown up) Just leaving when it happens</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although my actions are more socially acceptable now, the sensation is the same.
    Inside, I'm still that little kid rolling on the floor screaming, trying to get
    away. The only difference is that I have learned to fake
    it.
  </p>
  <h3>Play the Hand You're Dealt</h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, people dealt the "difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various
    social contexts" card get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This,
    perhaps, is what the world thinks autism "looks like".
  </p>
  <p>
    People who can't act the pain away often need more support because our world is a
    social world. But they are not any more "low-functioning" than I am
    "high-functioning". Those are descriptions of how <em>observers</em> experience our
    autism, not how we do. This is why these terms have fallen out of use since the
    DSM-5.
  </p>
  <h2>Masking</h2>
  <p>
    In the autism community we call the ability to fake not having autism
    <b>masking</b>. Those of us who can do it, do it ~every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Masking a hearing hypersensitivity is just one example. Autism can come with any
    sensory hypersensitivity, and any of several other symptoms. For many, you can find
    some great masking advice in online communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other symptoms people may mask are "stimming" (e.g. rocking or hand flapping;
    a positive behavior), lack of facial expressions, inability to cope with ambiguity
    or changing plans, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Masking comes with its own set of issues [2], particularly that it's enourmously
    exhausting; it's basically repurposing active brainpower to fill the shoes of
    missing social common sense. For me personally, this leaves me with less brainpower
    left to think through complex problems while in social situations&mdash;I literally
    am dumber when I am speaking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most people with autism agree that the best part of the day is that first moment
    alone when you can finally "unmask". That said, for all its downsides masking is a
    great tool and being able to use it is a blessing.
  </p>
  <h2>A Different Way to Think About Autism</h2>
  <p>
    2% of the world has autism. I didn't find out I did until I was 30 years old, and it
    explained so much. Maybe if I hadn't been so incentivized to hide it, I would have
    found out sooner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please encourage yourself and others to feel comfortable talking with family,
    friends, and doctors about ways you might feel different from others. It's a hard
    thing, to know if your brain is doing something different from other people's
    brains.
  </p>
  <p>
    If someone talks to you about it, be open to the idea that they might be
    onto something, instead of dismissing it as a character weakness to be overcome like
    so many people in my life did.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, the best thing I got out of it was just knowing what was wrong.
