# Mainframe

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/twos.dev/mainframe.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/twos.dev/mainframe) [{{ icon

_Mainframe_ is a daemon I wrote for myself to handle some personal automation
tasks that weren't portable or future-proof enough as shell scripts.

See the Go documentation (linked above) for details.
