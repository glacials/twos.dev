# 2023 in Review

## Photography

Every December, I challenge myself to concentrate the harvest of photos I take during the calendar year—each year's more bountiful than the last's—into a dense 13-photo album.

I've just selected and published the photos from 2023.
See them at [photos.html](/photos.html).

My photography gear this year has been the
[Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III](https://amzn.to/47nR3a9)
with the
[14–150mm ƒ4.0](https://amzn.to/48im3IS)
as my everyday carry / daytime lens, and the
[17mm](https://amzn.to/3vaUaUT),
[25mm](https://amzn.to/3tv8Eyj),
and
[45mm](https://amzn.to/3NATgXT)
ƒ1.8 lenses for low-light.

## Travel

In 2023, Summer and I were fortunate enough to go to
France,
Japan,
and China.

I've never been a traveler.
I bond with this style:

> I spend most of the day psyching myself up to do one thing—visit a museum, perhaps—and the rest of the day recovering from the only event on my itinerary.
>
> _—John Green, [The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://amzn.to/3Tzrdff)_

So it was not entirely surprising to discover this year that Summer and I enjoy spending 4–7 days in one city and dwelling,
with at least half of those days planless,
then going home.

## Interior Design

I continue my interior design hobby in the background,
but improvement comes slowly.
I discovered [Sweet Home 3D](https://www.sweethome3d.com) this year,
which has helped me visualize options quickly.
I've learned to not be picky about furniture visualizations.

We expect to move in 2024,
so I have been playing around with ideas.
I hope to share more later in the year.
