<h1>Tattoos as Moral Contracts</h1>

<p>
  This year, I got a tattoo. My morals had been at odds with my behaviors in a
  place very important to me—the climate crisis. It’s easy to think about how
  horrible the climate crisis is, and yes definitely someone should do something
  about it, yes probably those big corporations that sounds nice, now let’s
  forget about it for another year.
</p>
<p>
  This isn’t a great way to get things done and I had the cognizance to
  recognize that, but it kept happening to me. So I tattooed a reminder on my
  forearm.

<p>After six months with this puppy, it’s done more than I thought it could.</p>
<p>
  First, it’s a constant reminder. It’s not a checklist item I can mark off or
  that can fall to the bottom of my list. It can’t be forgotten about or left
  behind in an app change. It will be there as long as I will be, which is
  exactly how long I want to be conscious of the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>
  Second, it’s a social forcing function to act within my morals. When people
  ask me about my tattoo, I know I need to “have my story straight”. I need to
  know everything about myself that’s not better than climate par and have a
  roadmap for fixing it ready. No one expects me to be Captain Planet, but if I
  have a methane stove and don’t at least have a plan for going induction, well,
  that’s an embarrassing moment for someone with a climate crisis tattoo.
</p>
<p>
  In just six months these two pressures together have motivated me into
  research, action, and activism on how to make my kids and grandkids not spite
  me. I’m better informed about policy, I'm involved in local Seattle politics
  (actively pushing for more walk-friendly neighborhoods), and our house is
  running on 100% green energy. [2]

<p>
  If you have a lifelong motivation, a few hundred dollars, and a decent
  tolerance for pain, I recommend getting an aspirational tattoo.
