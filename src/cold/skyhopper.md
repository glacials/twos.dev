_A grasshopper-adjacent cocktail._

## Recipe

- 1 part blue curaçao
- 1 part white chocolate liqueur
- 1 part simple syrup
- 3 parts milk or milk substitute or 1 part heavy cream
- 2 dashes orange bitters

Combine all ingredients. Optionally shake and/or serve with ice.

## Purpose

The skyhopper is based on the grasshopper, which is traditionally 1:1:1 heavy
cream : crème de menthe : crème de cacao. We don't usually have heavy cream
around so we tend to substitute milk or a milk alternative and fill the glass,
yielding something like 6:1:1 milk : crème de menthe : crème de cacao.

Summer likes everything about the grasshopper except the mint flavor. I like
making grasshoppers because their ingredients are shelf stable and/or always on
hand (after the milk substitution). I started on a journey to replace the mint
with orange.

## Mint to Orange

Mint is a foundational flavor in the grasshopper, so simply replacing it with a
comparatively light flavor like blue curaçao causes the crème de cacao to fill
the flavor vacuum, turning it into a chocolatey drink.

Replacing the crème de cacao with white chocolate liqueur limits the chocolate
flavor's impact. The orange bitters then strengthen the orange more. The simple
syrup removes some flatness from the flavor when not using heavy cream (and can
probably be dropped otherwise).
