# Newsletter

Once in a long while I send out an email with personal updates about my life,
hobbies, and passions.

This is a bit more personal than my blog.
If you don't use RSS
it can also be a way to hear about my blog posts,
if a bit delayed.

No spam, no ads, no sponsors.
Volume is ~4 emails per year.

To subscribe,
send a blank email with the subject `SUBSCRIBE` to [`newsletter@twos.dev`](mailto:newsletter@twos.dev?subject=SUBSCRIBE).
Use this link to do that in your default mail client:

<center>
[SUBSCRIBE](mailto:newsletter@twos.dev?subject=SUBSCRIBE)
</center>

To unsubscribe at any time, send a blank email with subject `UNSUBSCRIBE` to [`newsletter@twos.dev`](mailto:newsletter@twos.dev?subject=UNSUBSCRIBE):

<center>
[UNSUBSCRIBE](mailto:newsletter@twos.dev?subject=UNSUBSCRIBE)
</center>

Talk to you there.
