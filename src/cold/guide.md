# The Ben Carlsson User Guide

This page describes things I value at work. This is descriptive of me, not
prescriptive to you; treat it as a set of FYIs, not requirements. Use or ignore
at your discretion, and share your own guide with me!

## Communication Style

<!-- Commenting because I like this idea, but it just doesn't belong here. Maybe somewhere else.
1. **Succinct**: The more people expected to read what I'm writing, the higher the
   cost/benefit of spending time honing it. For widespread pieces, 90% of my
   time is editing. [More](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html), [even
   more](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)
-->

1. **I like to synchronize *why*s but not *how*s.** Coordination is slow. As long as we share a
   common vision, I trust you to make [two-way door](https://shit.management/one-way-and-two-way-door-decisions/) decisions in motion without blocking on consensus. I ask that you trust me to do the same. We can continue to share progress in
   nonblocking
   ways^[To be clear I don't mean "don't do code reviews". I mean don't call team
   meetings for approval at every small-to-medium fork in the road. I trust you
   to do the research and make the call, then share your findings async.].

2. **I prefer asynchrony.** Social interaction [costs me
   brainpower](autism.html#masking) so I am more helpful
   when writing than speaking. In either case I'll understand your words
   better when given
   time to digest.
3. **I don't handle interruptions well** so notifications for my Slack and email are
   permanently off, even for DMs. A thirty second Slack conversation sets my brain back 15
   minutes, so this is how I protect my productivity.
   I'll see the red badge in my dock
   when I come up for air. If it's urgent, use the oncall flow.

4. **I prefer tickets to Slack.** I'm forgetful. I curb this with [external
   brain](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_(psychology)>) tricks,
   but I can more easily regain context when discussion is concentrated. I practice inbox zero, so you won't have to ping me
   about anything already in my inbox. I have a one business day SLA.
6. **I focus on customer problems.** Even if a solution "feels right" be prepared for me to
   ask what customer problem it solves.
7. **[Don't say hello](https://nohello.net/)**.

## Warnings

- **I go rogue.** Sometimes I'm so passionate about fixing or building something
  that I'll do it without tracking because the overhead—or its emotional
  burden—is bigger than the job itself. Some [adored
  features](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglcls%2Fstatus%2F720689621466619904&src=typed_query)
  have come out of having the freedom to do this; see #1 above.
- **I work weird hours.** Motivation strikes me randomly—sometimes during a
  workday but sometimes on a Sunday or at 4 AM or for 16 hours straight. To
  counterbalance, I shorten my workdays and the math roughly works out. If
  you see emails or commits from me with unhealthy-feeling timestamps, keep in
  mind my default workday is at ~70% capacity.
