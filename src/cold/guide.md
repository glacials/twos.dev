# The Ben Carlsson User Guide

This page describes things I value at work. This is descriptive of me, not
prescriptive to you; treat it as a set of FYIs, not requirements. Use or ignore
at your discretion, and share your own guide with me!

## Communication Style

<!-- Commenting because I like this idea, but it just doesn't belong here. Maybe somewhere else.
1. **Succinct**: The more people expected to read what I'm writing, the higher the
   cost/benefit of spending time honing it. For widespread pieces, 90% of my
   time is editing. [More](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html), [even
   more](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)
-->

1. **Synchronize *why*s, not *how*s**. Coordination is slow. As long as we share a
   common vision, I trust you to make decisions in motion without blocking on consensus
   every step of the way. I ask you to trust me to do the same. We can continue to share progress in
   nonblocking
   ways^[To be clear, I don't mean "don't do code reviews". I mean "don't call a team
   meeting to vote on how to improve X". I trust you to figure it out without me
   weighing you down.].

2. **Prefer asynchrony**. A 30-second interruption sets my brain
   back 30 minutes. To protect myself, I'll often hard-quit Slack in flow. If you have
   something
   on your mind text isn't good for, bonus points for an audio or screen recording.

3. **Talk in the ticket**. I'm forgetful, so I thrive with single-origin paper trails.
   They let me regain context easily, compared to smatterings of Slack discussions. I
   practice inbox zero, so if I get pinged in a ticket or PR, I will see
   it.
4. **Focus on the customer problem**. Even if a solution "feels right" be prepared for me to
   ask what customer problem it solves.
5. **[Don't say hello](https://nohello.net/)**.

## Warnings

- **My brain is 100% backburners.** Conversation <a href="autism.html#masking">costs me brainpower</a>, so I am
  more intelligible in writing than in unprepared speaking, and am better discussing
  something when given time to digest. I prefer pre-reading documents to reading them synchronously.
- **I go rogue.** Sometimes I'm so passionate about fixing or building something
  that I'll do it without tracking, because the overhead—or its emotional
  burden—is bigger than the job itself. Some [adored
  features](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglcls%2Fstatus%2F720689621466619904&src=typed_query)
  have come out of having the freedom to do this; see #2 above :D
- **I work weird hours.** Motivation strikes me randomly—sometimes during a
  workday but sometimes on a Sunday or at 4 AM or for 16 hours straight. To
  counterbalance, I shorten my workdays and the math roughly works out. So if
  you see emails or commits from me with unhealthy-feeling timestamps, keep in
  mind my default workday is at ~70% capacity.
