Below is what I value at work. This is descriptive of me, not
prescriptive to you; treat it as a set of FYIs, not requirements. Use or ignore
at your discretion, and share your own guide with me!

## Communication

<!-- Commenting because I like this idea, but it just doesn't belong here. Maybe somewhere else.
   **Succinct**: The more people expected to read what I'm writing, the higher the
   cost/benefit of spending time honing it. For widespread pieces, 90% of my
   time is editing. [More](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html), [even
   more](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)

I have a unique history with communication.
Ask me about it some time.

Here are the cliffs notes.

<h4>1. I work best with coordinated *why*s and uncoordinated *how*s.</h4>

Coordination is slow. As long as we share a common vision,
I trust you to make
[two-way door](https://shit.management/one-way-and-two-way-door-decisions/)
decisions in motion without blocking on consensus.
I ask that you trust me to do the same.
We can continue to share progress in nonblocking ways^[
To be clear I don't mean "don't do code reviews".
I mean don't call team meetings for approval at every small-to-medium fork in the road.
I trust you to do the research and make the call, then share your findings async.

<h4>2. I prefer asynchrony.</h4>

Social interaction [costs me brainpower](autism.html#masking)
so I am more helpful and better at problem-solving when writing than when speaking.
In either case I'll understand your words better when given time to digest.

<h4>3. I don't handle interruptions well.</h4>

Notifications for my Slack and email are often off, even for DMs.
A thirty second conversation sets my brain back 15 minutes, so this is how I protect my productivity.
I'll see the red badge in my dock when I come up for air.
If it's urgent, use the oncall flow.

<h4>4. I prefer tickets to Slack.</h4>

I'm forgetful.
I curb this with
[external brain](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_(psychology)>) tricks,
but I can more easily (re)gain context when discussion is concentrated in one place.

I practice inbox zero so you won't have to ping me about something already in my email,
like code reviews or ticket comments.

I have a one-business-day SLA on anything in my email inbox.

<h4>5. I focus on customer problems.</h4>

Even if a solution "feels right" be prepared for me to ask what customer problem it solves.

<h4>6. [Don't say hello](https://nohello.net/).</h4>

See `2` and `3`.

## Warnings

I'm always working on myself, but some dimensions are tougher to crack than others. Beware the following.

<h4>A. I go rogue.</h4>

Sometimes I'm so passionate about fixing or building something that
I'll do it without tracking because the overhead—or its emotional burden—
is bigger than the job itself.
Some
[adored features](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglcls%2Fstatus%2F720689621466619904&src=typed_query)
have come out of having the freedom to do this;
see #1 above.

<h4>B. I work weird hours.</h4>

Motivation strikes me randomly—sometimes during a workday,
but also sometimes on a Sunday, or at 4 AM, or for 16 hours straight.
To counterbalance, I shorten my workdays and the math roughly works out.
If you see emails or commits from me with unhealthy-feeling timestamps,
keep in mind my default workday is at ~70% capacity.
