# Today, You Woke Up for the Last Time

You've just discovered that today, you woke up for the last time.
You're perfectly healthy, and you'll still be around tomorrow.
But you and every other human has been cured of the need and ability to sleep.

You will never get sleepy again,
and none of the ill effects of going without sleep will apply.
You can still get physically and mentally tired and need to sometimes rest from activity,
but that rest will be conscious,
like relaxing on the couch with some form of media.

# Physical Storefronts

Storefronts and restaurants won't close and open anymore.
24-hour businesses will be much more common.
Properly lighting cities suddenly becomes a lot more important,
as does the safety of traveling alone at night.

At first, the day takes on two halves: work and not-work.
Not-work absorbs the entire night.
