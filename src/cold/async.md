# Why Be Synchronous?

Asynchrony vs. synchrony is a constant struggle. Design meeting or design doc?
Pair programming or code review? [Pop-in](thepopin.html) or Slack message?

Synchrony grants speed, but asynchrony grants efficiency. Like debt each has
their use, and each can be misused. As engineers we love to spout the good word
of asynchrony so we can reclaim some time to actually build stuff, but there's
nothing like a five-minute conversation to take the place of a weeklong email
thread.

I've been in a secure war room exactly once in my career, for a week minus sleep
handling a business-threatening emergency.^[Before tech OSHA jumps on me: I was
young, we were treated like royalty, and looking back I have nothing but fond
memories akin to a LAN party.] In that room we built some of the fastest product
I've ever had the pleasure of vomiting onto my keyboard.

It solved the problem well. And we spent six months cleaning it up. That both
those statements can be true is oft overlooked by engineers, junior and senior.

Like tech debt, synchrony trades away future velocity for present velocity.
Sometimes you need that.

If you optimize too much for the future, you'll die before you get there. It's
up to each project, team, org to find the right balance. I recommend asynchrony
by default, with an eye trained on the efforts that really need to succeed in
the present.

Employ synchrony when you need speed, but don’t call a 10-person meeting for
anything that doesn't.
