# `src/cold`

This directory holds partial HTML files that will be surrounded with a header
and footer at build-time and rendered into pages.

For the most part, things here originated as Markdown from [`src/warm`](../warm)
but got too complex to keep in Markdown, or got stable enough that I felt better
"freezing" them into HTML one last time.
