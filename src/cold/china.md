# China

Summer and I recently returned from China. We hit Harbin, where her family lives, and Daqing, where she grew up. Both of these cities are in the far north of China, near the borders with Mongolia and Russia. They don’t see many westerners.

## Natural Refrigeration

Kitchens this far north use their pantries as natural refrigerators, with the framing of the building set to expose 2–3 pantry walls to the exterior, with a closable door connecting to the kitchen.
Many residences do not have powered refrigerators.

Summer shared a joke that in the winter, when restaurants ask if you want a beer from the fridge or the pantry, the fridge ones are 0ºC (32ºF) while the pantry ones are -30ºC (-22ºF).

## Drinking Together

Many countries have moments when everyone raises their glasses and drinks: "cheers", "skål", "salud", etc.

China has the same (干杯 _ganbei_, literally "dry cup"), but it seems less acceptable to drink outside of these times.
Whenever I attempted to sip independently someone would steal a glance and interject with a cheery “干杯！ganbei!” that brought the table to the moment.

Meals were filled with dozens upon dozens of "干杯 ganbei!"s.

## Smoking

Smoking in China is technically banned in restaurants, but everyone does it anyway. There’s no enforcement, and the tobacco industry is nationalized. Tobacco comprises 5–10% of government revenue. (TODO: Stats, citation)

## Purchasing Unfinished Homes

Homes in China—most families live in condominiums—are built and purchased unfinished, the same way an American home may come with an unfinished basement.

The buyer then picks fixtures and finishes and pays for them separately.

## Identical Buildings

It's common to see groups of nearby buildings sharing a single design. You see this once in a while for two or three buildings in the US, but it's far more common in China, and each design is implemented instead by four, five, six, or more buildings. Combined with my point on unfinished condos above, I get the sense China treats construction as something best done with economies of scale, as a rule.

## Interesting Snacks

Some various interesting snacks I saw and tried:

## Internet QR payments with audio announcements

Pay-by-phone is universally accepted and expected in businesses, but there’s no tap-to-pay. Business have QR codes posted that point to WeChat accounts. The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet like you would to a Venmo account. A nearby store speaker announces the incoming payment and amount automatically, signaling to the shopkeeper that you have paid.

## Westerners in social media

After two weeks In Harbin, a city with a small international airport, I saw only one obviously non-Chinese person. In Daqing, children in the street abruptly stopped playing and talking to stare agape as I walked by. Adults sitting at nearby tables in restaurants struck up conversation or stared.

It’s no surprise then that Summer’s family had never met an American, but they had been exposed to tropes, stereotypes, and the extreme political right on social media. They were surprised by my politeness and slightly sunny disposition.

## Advertising with noise, megaphones

China cities are much noisier at advertising. It's common to hear background megaphones in the distance that at first give you a City 17 vibe, until you realize they're advertising their fruit or some such on repeat.

## Sewage Smell

About 1 in 100 inhalations had a strong sewage odor, both on the street and when home. Western countries use "traps” in their plumbing, which prevent smells from traveling backwards through pipes and coming out of places like your shower drain.

(TODO: Diagram)

A trap is a vertical doubling-back of the drain such that a buffer of water prevents airflow. It makes the piping airtight but not watertight.

## Public restrooms toilet paper and soap

Public restrooms generally don’t have toilet paper or soap.

## Pooping in a Hole

I heard I'd have to "poop in a hole", which it's technically true, but the phrasing was a bit harsh. It's more like the extreme version of a [squatty potty](https://amzn.to/3Qpa864).
