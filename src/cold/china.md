# Surprises in North China

Summer and I recently stayed a few weeks with her parents in Harbin, China.
They don’t see many westerners.

It gets damn cold.

Harbin is near the northern border, far beyond the popular cities.

A few things surprised me about the culture there.
What follows is a list of my miniature culture shocks.

## Natural Refrigeration

Kitchens this far north use their pantries as natural refrigerators, with the framing of the building set to expose 2–3 pantry walls to the exterior.

Many residences do not have powered refrigerators.

More exposed surface area means more and faster cooling.

The pantry can be used to both cool and dry food.

Summer shared an anecdote that in the winter, when a restaurant asks if you want a beer from the fridge or the pantry,
the fridge ones are _warmer_.

## Water

Tap water in China is not potable.
Filters are around but after generations of boiling water, everyone just likes hot water more than cold.

In retrospect, it makes total sense evolutionarily why some cultures would benefit from cold water and some from hot.

## Smoking

Smoking in restaurants is technically banned, but everyone does it because there's no enforcement. And there's no incentive to enforce it because tobacco is nationalized and comprises 7% of government revenue.^[https://www.theexamination.org/articles/how-china-became-addicted-to-its-tobacco-monopoly]

## Purchasing Unfinished Homes

Homes in China—most families live in condominiums—are built and purchased unfinished, the same way an American home may come with an unfinished basement.

The buyer then picks fixtures and finishes and pays for them separately.

## Identical Buildings

It's common to see groups of nearby buildings sharing a single design. You see this once in a while for two or three buildings in the US, but it's far more common in China, and each design is implemented instead by four, five, six, or more buildings. Combined with my point on unfinished condos above, I get the sense China treats construction as something best done with economies of scale, as a rule.

## Interesting Snacks

Some various interesting snacks I saw and tried:

Bread soda. Watch out for bloating.

![A photo of a small disposable bowl of wide noodles with veggies mixed in. In the background is a night market.](/img/china-kaolengmian.jpeg)

烤冷面 kǎolěngmiàn ("grilled cold noodles"), my years-long favorite Chinese food.

![A photo of me, a white man, dipping a long donut-looking item in a cup of soy milk. We are sitting at a table on the street and the sun is rising.](/img/china-youtiao.jpeg)

Plain donuts (油条 yóutiáo) dipped in soy milk (豆浆 dòujiāng), a common if unhealthy breakfast.

## Internet QR payments with audio announcements

Pay-by-phone is universally accepted and expected in businesses, but there’s no tap-to-pay. Business have QR codes posted that point to WeChat accounts. The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet like you would to a Venmo account. A nearby store speaker announces the incoming payment and amount automatically, signaling to the shopkeeper that you have paid.

## City Limits

Harbin's population is 5M, which sounds dense.
But geographically, China's cities tend to be more like US counties or metropolitan areas.

![The city limits of New York, NY, USA overlaid on the city limits of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. New York City's city limits are tiny in comparison, only about 2% of the size.](/img/china-ny.png)

New York City (solid red) is ~2% the area of Harbin (dotted red).

For reference, some densities:

- Harbin, China: \~100 people / km^[\~5M people in 53,068 km²]
- Seattle, WA: \~2k people / km^[737k people in 367 km²]
- Greater Seattle Area^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_metropolitan_area]: \~250 people / km^[\~4M people in \~15k km²]
- New York, NY: \~6500 people / km^[\~8M people in 1213 km²]
- New York Metropolitan Area^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area]: \~2100 people / km^[\~19M people in 8936 km²]

## Westerners in Social Media

After two weeks In Harbin, a city with a small international airport, I saw only one obviously non-Chinese person. In Daqing, children in the street abruptly stopped playing and talking to stare agape as I walked by. Adults sitting at nearby tables in restaurants struck up conversation or stared.

It’s no surprise then that Summer’s family had never met an American, but they had been exposed to tropes, stereotypes, and the extreme political right on social media. They were surprised by my politeness and slightly sunny disposition.

## Megaphones

China cities are much noisier at advertising. It's common to hear background megaphones in the distance that at first give you a City 17 vibe, until you realize they're advertising their fruit or some such on repeat.

## Sewage Smell

About 1 in 100 inhalations had a strong sewage odor, both on the street and when home. Western countries use "traps” in their plumbing, which prevent smells from traveling backwards through pipes and coming out of places like your shower drain.

(TODO: Diagram)

A trap is a vertical doubling-back of the drain such that a buffer of water prevents airflow. It makes the piping airtight but not watertight.
