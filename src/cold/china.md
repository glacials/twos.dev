# China


  


In autumn, Summer and I visited China. We hit Harbin, where her family lives, and Daqing, where she grew up. Both of these cities are in the far north of China, near the borders with Mongolia and Russia. They don’t see many westerners.

  


While there, I wrote down some interesting culture differences even Summer hadn’t noticed.

  


**Natural Refrigeration**

  


Home kitchens in northern China are built to have what we might call _pantries_ having 2–3 walls facing outside via floor-to-ceiling windows. This is a way to refrigerate and dehumidify using the elements. It’s not a given that every residence has a powered residential refrigerator because this method is so effective, especially in winter.

Summer shared a joke that in the winter, when restaurants ask if you want an electrically refrigerated or unrefrigerated beer, the refrigerated ones are 0ºC (32ºF) while the unrefrigerated ones are -30ºC (-22ºF) because they have been stored effectively outside.

  


When you have leftovers from a hot meal, it's common to put the leftovers into the pantry and let nature do the work overnight.

  


**Everyone drinks together **

  


Many countries have moments when everyone raises their glasses and drinks: "cheers", "skål", "salud", etc.

  


China has the same (干杯 _ganbei_, literally "dry cup"), but it is less acceptable to drink outside of these times. Meals were filled with dozens upon dozens of 干杯 _ganbei_s. Whenever I attempted to sip independently someone would steal a glance and interject with a cheery “干杯！_ganbei!_” that riled the whole table.

  


**Smoking**

  


Smoking in China is technically banned in restaurants, but everyone does it anyway. There’s no enforcement, and there’s a perverse incentive not to enforce—the tobacco industry is nationalized, and makes up 5–10% of government revenue. (TODO: Stats, citations)

  


**Condos only**

  


Single-family homes are uncommon in China. Oddly, traffic in Harbin is worse. Perhaps because or perhaps despite, the standard city arterial is ten lanes wide.

  


**Purchase condo unfinished**

  


Homes in China are built and purchased unfinished, the same way a home in the US may be sold with an unfinished basement.

The buyer then picks fixtures and finishes and pays for them separately, the same way we do for furniture in the western world

.

**Identical buildings**

  


It's common to see groups of nearby buildings sharing a single design. You see this once in a while for two or three buildings in the US, but it's far more common in China, and each design is implemented instead by four, five, six, or more buildings. Combined with my point on unfinished condos above, I get the sense China treats construction as something best done with economies of scale, as a rule.

**Interesting Snacks**

  


Some various interesting snacks I saw and tried:

  


  * Bread Soda

  


**Internet QR payments with audio announcements**

  


Pay-by-phone is universally accepted and expected in businesses, but there’s no tap-to-pay. Business have QR codes posted that point to WeChat accounts. The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet like you would to a Venmo account. A nearby store speaker announces the incoming payment and amount automatically, signaling to the shopkeeper that you have paid.

  


**Red sugar (dongbei) vs black sugar vs brown sugar **

  


**Westerners in social media**

  


After two weeks In Harbin, a city with a small international airport, I saw only one obviously non-Chinese person. In Daqing, children in the street abruptly stopped playing and talking to stare agape as I walked by. Adults sitting at nearby tables in restaurants struck up conversation or stared.

  


It’s no surprise then that Summer’s family had never met an American, but they had been exposed to tropes, stereotypes, and the extreme political right on social media. They were surprised by my politeness and slightly sunny disposition.

  


**Advertising with noise, megaphones **

  


China cities are much noisier at advertising. It's common to hear background megaphones in the distance that at first give you a City 17 vibe, until you realize they're advertising their fruit or some such on repeat.

  


**Sewage Smell**

  


About 1 in 100 inhalations had a strong sewage odor, both on the street and when home. Western countries use "traps” in their plumbing, which prevent smells from traveling backwards through pipes and coming out of places like your shower drain.

  


(TODO: Diagram)

  


A trap is a vertical doubling-back of the drain such that a buffer of water prevents airflow. It makes the piping airtight but not watertight.

  


**Halfway Table Service**

  


At nice restaurants in China (TODO: confirm) it's common to order food in a "counter" setting, only instead of a counter there's an attendant following you around while you browse the menu as displayed in large photos on multiple walls, like an art gallery.

When you've completed your order, you go to your table and the rest of the experience is in the style of American table service, including ordering additional dishes. (TODO: confirm)

  


**bring your own toilet paper and soap around**

  


**poop in a hole**
