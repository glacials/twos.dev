# Surprises in North China

Summer and I recently stayed a few weeks with her parents in Harbin, China.

[![A satellite map zoomed out to see most of china. Harbin is circled in the far northeast.](/img/china-harbin.png)](/img/china-harbin.png)

Harbin is near the northern border, far beyond the popular cities.

A few things caught me off guard about the culture there.

## Natural Refrigeration

Kitchens this far north use their pantries as natural refrigerators, with the framing of the building set to expose 2–3 pantry walls to the exterior.

Many residences do not have powered refrigerators.

More exposed surface area means more and faster cooling.

The pantry can be used to both cool and dry food.

Summer shared a half-joke that in the winter,
if you want your restaurant beer served less cold,
you ask for a refrigerated one.
They're warmer than then pantry-stored ones.

## Hot Water

People in China drink their water hot, not cold.
The tap water is not potable, so you have to sterilize it by boiling it.
After generations of this,
I guess people just preferred their water hot even as filtering became usable.

It is even embedded in traditional Chinese medicine that you must drink hot water to restore your body's _yang_.
After emigrating, Summer would get stomacheaches from drinking cold water on an empty stomach.
Whether it was physiological or psychosomatic,
it is clear a lifetime of drinking one temperature of water can have an effect on a person,
so I don't exactly blame anyone for the preference or belief.

There was some effort in convincing her family I wasn't injuring myself by ordering and drinking cold water instead.

## Smoking

Smoking is huge in China.
It consumes about half of all cigarattes.

Smoking in restaurants is technically banned, but everyone does it because there's no enforcement.
There's no incentive to enforce it because tobacco is nationalized, bringing in ~7% of all government revenue.^[https://www.theexamination.org/articles/how-china-became-addicted-to-its-tobacco-monopoly]

## Food

The food was by far the best part of China,
though I've had a few years to acclimate my taste in Seattle and Vancouver.

Some notable items I tried:

![A photo of a clear bottle of gold-colored fizzy liquid, with a label depicting a loaf of bread.](/img/china-breadsoda.jpg)

Bread soda. Watch out for bloating.

![A photo of a small disposable bowl of wide noodles with veggies mixed in. In the background is a night market.](/img/china-kaolengmian.jpeg)

烤冷面 kǎolěngmiàn ("grilled cold noodles"), my years-long favorite Chinese food.

![A photo of me, a white man, dipping a long donut-looking item in a cup of soy milk. We are sitting at a table on the street and the sun is rising.](/img/china-youtiao.jpeg)

Plain donuts (油条 yóutiáo) dipped in soy milk (豆浆 dòujiāng), a common if unhealthy breakfast.

![A photo of seemingly normal cheese pizza.](/img/china-pizza.jpeg)

Pizza Hut is a pseudodelicacy in China, similar to sushi in the US.
It looks the same, but this pizza uses cream cheese and has a sweet, oily crust.

![A photo of an egg tart in KFC packaging.](/img/china-kfc.jpeg)

KFC sells egg tarts and a few other Chinese items.
Neither of us enjoyed them, but it was interesting exploring international chains' local menus.

![A photo of yumi lao, which looks like like (and is) a sugary mass of fried corn.](/img/china-yumilao.jpeg)

Fried corn fritters (玉米烙 yùmǐlào) taste like a sugary cross between popcorn, kettle corn, and corn.
If you like those flavors, you'll love these.

## QR Payments

Pay-by-phone is universally accepted and expected in businesses, but there’s no tap-to-pay.

Instead, small businesses have QR codes posted on their walls that point to WeChat accounts.
The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet, like a Venmo payment.

A nearby store speaker announces incoming payment amounts automatically,
signaling to the shopkeeper that you have paid.

## City Limits

Harbin's population is 5M, which sounds dense.
But geographically, China's cities tend to be more like US counties or metropolitan areas.

![The city limits of New York, NY, USA overlaid on the city limits of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. New York City's city limits are tiny in comparison, only about 2% of the size.](/img/china-ny.png)

New York City (solid red) is ~2% the area of Harbin (dotted red).

For example, take Beijing:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/charts.min.css"></style>
<div class="chart">
<table class="charts-css bar data-spacing-10 multiple show-data-axes show-labels">

<td style="--size: calc(19617869 / 21893095)"><span class="data tooltip">19,617,869 people</span></td>
<td style="--size: calc(8936 / 53068)"><span class="data tooltip">8,936 km²</span></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul class="charts-css legend legend-square">
  <li>Population</li>
  <li>Area</li>
  <li>Density</li>
</ul>
</div>

Beijing more resembles Greater New York—a conglomeration of over 70 cities—than it does New York City.
The same pattern holds for Harbin at a smaller scale.

This conclusion took some effort to reach, as I had only ever heard that Harbin was a "small town" and that it had 5M people,
an initially astonishing pair of facts I attributed to China simply having an order of magnitude more people than the US.

## Westerners in Social Media

I'm very white.

![A photo of me and Summer dressed up at a nice dinner. I am white. Summer is Chinese. We are both laughing and I am showing the 'sign of the horns'.](/img/china-white.jpg)

Me and Summer.

After two weeks in Harbin,
which has an international airport (albeit small),
I saw only one obviously non-Chinese person.
In Daqing, two hours away by car,
children in the street stopped playing to stare at me.
Adults at nearby tables in restaurants struck up conversations or stared.

Summer’s family had never met an American,
but they had been exposed to extreme tropes and stereotypes on social media,
mostly—though they didn't know it—about the extreme political right.
They were surprised by my kindness, politeness, and sunny disposition.

## Sewage

It's not omnipresent, but every few dozen breaths carry a sewage smell.
Chinese plumbing tends not to use traps, which are plumbing tricks that prevent smells from traveling backwards up sewer liens.

![A sketch of two types of traps, which look like capital 'N' shapes where the water comes in the top-right of the 'N' and leaves the bottom-left of it, leaving the middle section always full with a buffer of water, preventing air from traveling from the bottom-left to the top-right.](/img/china-trap.png)

Traps make pipes airtight but not watertight. (Image: [Nordisk Familjebok, 1921](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vattenlaas.png))

Traps are all over the place in western plumbing.
You can retrofit a trapless Chinese system with an aftermarket component,
but the one we tried drained prohibitively slowly,
so was effectively a plug.
