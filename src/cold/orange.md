# Orange is my favorite color

So here was my day:

- **12:00a** – The Orange Box is released. I am asleep, but have already paid
  for and preloaded it.
- **4:00a** – I wake up inadvertently from excitement! I shower and get all my
  get-readying for school over with.
- **4:25a** – I start playing Portal.
- **5:30a** – The four alarms I set in fifteen minute increments start. I had
  planned to wake now, but I’m already up (and thinking with portals). Alarms
  get turned off.
- **7:00a** – I beat Portal! I check out some of the bonus levels I unlocked, as
  well as skim over the achievements section. Man, there’re still a lot of
  things I can do!
- **7:10a** – I start playing Half-Life 2: Episode Two.
- **8:00a** – School. I have fun watching my friends’ faces when I tell them
  that I woke up at 4am to play Portal — and that I beat it before school. I
  love emotion! I also casually inform anyone who would eventually play Portal
  that the cake is a lie — including my physics desk. I am also the least tired
  I remember being for quite a while throughout the day — an odd occurrence,
  considering my operating hours for this day.
- **3:30p** – I nervously show some family members how Portal works. I want to
  play Episode Two! That’s what I get for showing them the trailer.
- **4:00p** – Back to HL2:E2.
- **8:30p** – Episode Two: beaten.

This was pretty much my favorite day in quite a while. The following are rants
about the awesomeness about the games involved in it.

**Portal** is _awesome_. Let me say that I’m not totally new to this concept —
I’ve very repeatedly played with similar systems in Prey (with the custom
portal-creation mod) and Narbacular Drop (the game from which _Portal_ evolved,
created by a group of students from Digipen who now all happily work for Valve),
but Portal combines the slickness and meaning of the former with the
portal-focused gameplay from the latter to make an — I simply must repeat myself
— awesome game.

I’ve said before that I’m a huge storyline guy, and although no trailers do this
one justice, the intricacy of it is really something to take into consideration;
it’s much deeper than you’d imagine, even after playing completely through it.
At first you’re just like, “Oh, so I’m this test participant for this awesome
portal stuff, that’s cool”, but it gets so much more intricate — to an amount
that I actually do not know at this time, but is sure to be hinted at upon the
arrival of Episode Three (yep, you guessed it — _Portal_ takes place in the
Half-Life universe, and this is actually apparent during play of Episode Two; a
matter which surely will be delved into further along in the episodes).

As for **Episode Two**: JEEZ VALVE, FINALLY!

Now that that’s out of my system, I can say that it’s actually a pretty good
game. You can really tell how much work they put into the engine — maybe not
through huge, blatantly noticeable things, but small things, like how when
you’re in a cave the light reflections look much, well, shinier, and how (I love
this) when you spin to face another direction really fast, your screen actually
_blurs_ — it sounds trivial, but it’s a pretty awesome thing when you notice it
for the first time (if you came into my room when I noticed it, you’d just watch
me spinning around in circles really fast for about two minutes straight).

There isn’t a _whole_ lot of new stuff in it (a new car and a new type of mine
come to mind), but the storyline actually starts to connect more with that of
Half-Life 1 (notice I only said starts to — there are just a few things
mentioned about some memories from the original Half-Life that could have to do
with your future success), as well as _Portal_, as I mentioned already.

I hate to leave _Team Fortress 2_ out of the party, but I’d already played it in
beta, so I’m not as super-excited about it right now. Make no mistake, though:
The Orange Box is a purchase _well_ worth the money if you’re any sort of fan at
all of Half-Life or its relatives. Come to think of it, I think most people
would enjoy _Portal_ despite their gaming background.
