# Shouldering time

This couldn’t have been more horribly timed.

As some of you may know, I’m in the middle of a slew of awesome games right now.
There are just too many I need to play — it’s like when two of your favorite
shows are on at the same time. And, uh, you are twenty years in the past. Where,
y’know, you can’t download/stream/browse on demand for/digitally record them.

But watch your back — the gaming gods get mad at you when you [play with
fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft) — I’m proof of that.

Today, my DS broke. Broke is a rather vague word, so I’ll explain.

Only a couple days ago, I noticed my L button wasn’t functioning as smoothly as
it’s supposed to — one of the games I’ve been playing lately is Megaman ZX
(which I haven’t covered in my rounds yet), and one of the fastest ways to
travel is by using Model Hx (the biometal of the wind) to dash-jump, air dash,
and repeat. Both of those moves require the L button (dash), which is how I
first noticed it (of course, that constant use probably didn’t help, but hey, I
didn’t do anything wrong).

Instead of being able to press it from the edge, I had to hug my finger around
the top of the DS and push it down, and pretty hard.

Yesterday, it stopped functioning altogether. I was playing [Geometry
Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars:_Galaxies#Nintendo_DS_and_Wii_versions)
and kept wondering, _Why are all these new levels not giving me any bombs?_ And
of course, I still don’t know which symbol means _bombs_ and which means lives.

So yeah, point made, my L button is broken. And I’m sad. Because there are five
DS games in queue for me right now (yup, those are all upcoming game loads), and
I have to send off my DS to get repaired.

At least it’s in the warranty. And Nintendo’s usually [really
cool](http://fiendishgleeclub.vox.com/library/post/customer-service-gone-shockingly-right.html)
about this kind of stuff, so I don’t expect any problems to come up.

Maybe the gaming gods are looking out for me after all.
