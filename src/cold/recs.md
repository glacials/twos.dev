# Recommendations

There are a small number of products in my life that, in little ways, are
life-changing. These are them.

## 5.11 Belt

I wear a belt every day.
I used to buy a new one every 1–2 years,
then I got [this belt](https://amzn.to/3ptyErI).

That was 10 years ago.
I have worn it > 95% of days since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear.
I expect I will never buy another belt.

## Micro Four Thirds

For photography folks.

Micro Four Thirds is a camera and lens conector.
Unlike most proprietary systems,
it's an open standard with many companies participating.
The de facto flagships are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.

Its biggest advantage is its high `photo quality : gear size` ratio.
My archenemy is not having my camera with me;
every time I have to settle for my phone camera I question having a camera at all.

Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can fit my setup in ~half the space as before.
That means a full-day setup in a 20L backpack,
a camera + couple lenses in a 6L sling,
or a camera + lens in a 2L chest pouch.

I'm using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III
([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3PtUO81) /
[OM System](https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii)).

## A Long, Mountable Power Strip

Mounting a hilariously long power strip under every desk in my house,
paired with [any cheap](https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa) cable basket,
has given me the best and easiest cable management I've ever had.

It's important to overbudget your outlets by ~2x and to go long, not fat,
so cables can plug in where they are instead of playing musical chairs with a rat's nest of wall warts.

Any will do, but I use these: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/44e4c3W) /

## Noctua Fans

As a [noise-sensitive](autism.html) person whose hobbies involve computers,
silence is important to me in a gaming machine.
Noctua makes giant, silent, brown fans. That's it.

Once I got one I could never switch back.
My build is centered around their obnoxiously large [fanned heatsink](https://amzn.to/3pyrIJU),
and has been purring for six years.
I expect to reuse the same fans for my next build, whenever it is.

## Jetz Scrubz Sponges

These kitchen sponges are easily a 10x–100x improvement over the traditional sponges,
in all of these categories:

- Lifespan before getting damaged
- Lifespan before getting permanently gross
- Tendancy to get temporarily gross
- Ease of cleaning once temporarily gross

They're pricier upfront, but cheaper long-term.

# In Search Of

I'm in search of a life-changing product for these categories. Please [email
me](mailto:ben@twos.dev) if you have recommendations.

## Water Bottle

I am in search of a reusable water bottle with the following qualities:

- Can last 10+ years
- Can last a week of no washing without getting funky
- Is less than ~9cm in diameter (i.e. a comfortable size for a Peak Design Everyday
  Backpack V1 20L cup holder)
- Holds about 1L
- Attached or attachable lid
- Ability to stay cold ~1 day preferred

The closest I ever came was the [Thermos Element 5 32 oz](https://amzn.to/42XJaoR), but
I lost mine and the product has since discontinued.

## Hair Trimmer

I am in search of a combination beard and head trimmer with these qualities:

- Can last 3+ years
- USB-C chargeable
- Has two or fewer attachments, or a good organization system for attachments
- Can trim beards in the 1~6mm range
- Can trim head hair in the 1~3cm range
- Requires no more than two passes for reasonable coverage

The closest I've found in my research is the
[MANSCAPED Beard Hedger](https://amzn.to/3rFxMBB),
but it seems to need five or more passes for good coverage.
