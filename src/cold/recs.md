# Recommendations

There are a small number of products or behaviors in my life that, in little ways, are
life-changing. These are them.

## 5.11 Belt

I wear a belt every day. I used to replace them every 1–2 years, then I got [this
belt](https://amzn.to/3ptyErI). That was 10 years ago. I have worn it > 95% of days
since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear. I expect I will never buy another belt.

## Micro Four Thirds

Micro Four Thirds is a camera + lens conector and system (like Canon EF or Fujifilm X).
It's an open standard with many companies participating, although the de facto flagships
are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.

Its biggest advantage is its high `photo quality : bag space required` ratio. My general
photography archenemy is not having my camera with me; every time I have to settle for
my phone camera I question the point of continuing my photography hobby at all.

Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can bring roughly 2x the gear per bag volume. Or put
another way, I can travel with half the bag volume. For me this means a larger setup
fits in a 20L backpack, a camera + couple lenses fits in a 6L sling, and a camera + lens
squeezes into a 2L chest pouch.

I'm using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3PtUO81) / [OM
System](https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii))

## Any Giant Mountable Power Strip

Mounting one of these on the bottom of every desk in the house, paired with [any
cheap](https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa) cable basket, was the easiest form of cable management
I've ever leveraged. Using a skinny frame and allowing for ~double the number of outlets
you actually need means every cable can plug in _where it is_, instead of routing all
cables to a central rat's nest whose residents constantly play musical chairs.

## Noctua Fans

As a [noise-sensitive](autism.html) person whose major hobbies are mostly in front of
computers, silence is important to me in a gaming machine. Noctua makes giant, silent,
brown fans. That's it.

Once I got one I could never switch back. My next build was centered around the giant
fan-based heatsink. That build in that exact state has been purring for six years now. I
haven't even opened it up for cleaning in three. I expect to reuse the same fans for my
next build, whenever it is.

## Jetz Scrubz Sponges

These lil buddies are easily a 10x–100x improvement over your traditional yellow and
green sponges in all of these categories: lifespan before being damaged, lifespan before
being permanently gross, tendancy to get temporarily gross, ease of cleaning once
temporarily gross.

They're pricier, but I've found in the long run the life span makes them cheaper.

# In Search Of

I'm in search of a life-changing product for these categories. Please [email
me](mailto:ben@twos.dev) if you have recommendations.

## Water Bottle

I am in search of a reusable water bottle that can last 10+ years with the following
qualities:

- Can last a week of no washing without getting funky
- Is less than ~9cm in diameter (i.e. a comfortable size for a Peak Design Everyday
  Backpack V1 20L cup holder)
- Holds about 1L
- Unlosable lid (i.e. attached to body, even when off)
- Ability to stay cold ~1 day preferred

The closest I ever came was the [Thermos Element 5 32 oz](https://amzn.to/42XJaoR), but
I lost mine and the product has since discontinued.
