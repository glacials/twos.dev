# Goodbye, Splits.io

'Hoy.

I'm very sad to share that Splits.io will shut down December 1, 2024.

You can export runs as normal until December 1. After that date, `splits.io` will be replaced with an export-only web page where you can fetch runs by permalink or in bulk by username. You can test that page [here](https://retriever.splits.io), although before December 1 it will only have data through 2023.

I plan to keep `splits.io` in that state for one year, but will keep it online indefinitely beyond that within reason. Storage was always the cheapest part of Splits.io.

I started Splits.io as a college project 11 years ago and am super proud of where we have arrived. It's tough to have to shut it down. It always lost money as a side project, so when I made it a full-time job in 2019 and got Tuna and Bated on board, our first goal was to make it financially self-sustaining.

Bated trimmed a bunch of fat from our infrastructure while somehow also making us more stable (anyone who was a user in 2018 remembers that we crashed ~daily).

Tuna handled the business side and grew us by understanding users and working behind the scenes on partnerships.

We're proud we got it to the point that it actually did pay for itself, before we had to return to normal jobs in 2020. Those efforts are what have taken us through these last six years of operation smoothly. Unfortunately the well has dried up and we're not in the position to drop everything a second time, nor to foot the bills.

Splits.io remains open source, as it has been since day 1 back in 2013. To anyone wishing to stand up a clone from its source, you have my support and I'm happy to answer questions that come up, though we will not be transferring non-public user data without consent.

Thank you for using Splits.io. Everyone says this so please read past the cliche insincerity when I say: _you made it worth it._ Every day I woke up to comments about Splits.io was a motivational day. Every period of low motivation was eventually ended with a single flippant "what a neat tool!" granting weeks of renewed energy.

If there's one thing you take from this read, please let it be to give more builders and creators positive comments. Encouragement is positive-sum.

Special thanks to those who contributed code or otherwise helped speedrunning tech become more open source.
