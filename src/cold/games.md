# Special One-Time Games

These are the most special gaming experiences I've had.

This is not a list of my favorite games.
It is closer to a list of games that,
because of some unique thing,
I wish I could play for the first time again.

## Celeste

## Control

Atmosphere.

## Outer Wilds

Exploration.

## Spec Ops: The Line

Story.

## The Beginner's Guide

## Titanfall 2

Story.
