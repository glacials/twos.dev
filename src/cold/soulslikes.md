# Why Are Soulslikes Fun?

I had not played many soulslikes before _Elden Ring_.
But when I lost track of time and dumped 350 hours into it,
I figured I should pay my respects to its forebears.

I played through the whole From Software catalog,
and after staring at the gameless void on the other side I turned to other developers' soulslikes.
It was there I learned that there's nothing like a From Software soulslike.

There's something different about them.
No soulslike I played afterward felt quite the same,
as if they had only one foot in the genre I thought I had come to know,
and the other in traditional action-adventure.

## Constraints

Gaming is constraints.
A game designer's aim is not to funnel the player to the goal efficiently,
like a traditional software product.
That is the _player's_ goal.

The designer's goal is for the player to have fun.
It is not fun to start a game, walk forward one pace, and then have beaten the game.
It's also not fun to be given the best weapon in the game in the first level and destroy everything without challenge.
So a large part of game design is building obstacles.

The player will solve for the goal optimally,
even if it's not fun.
They will farm boars for hours,
loot treasure through walls,
and spend skill points on the boring but effective skills,
in the name of reaching their goal.

### Constraints Lost to Time

A long time ago,
a large part of single-player gaming was strategizing with friends.
You would play some game alone at home,
then the next day you'd exchange ideas and strategies with your buddies.

It was fun,
in the same way it's fun when a TV series trickles out one episode a week and you get to theorize and bet with friends on what's coming next.
(It's fantastic marketing, actually.)

This brought a social component to single player games.
I'll never forget getting stuck outside Jabu Jabu in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time because
two friends *independently* told me you have to shoot Jabu-Jabu's eye to get him to open his mouth,
spiraling me into desperate and creative slingshot angles and hours of farming deku nuts for ammo.
(The real answer was... not that.)

This social aspect is the player's solution to an **imperfect information constraint**.
Solving that constraint was fun and challenging in and of itself.

I did not know how to open Jabu-Jabu's mouth,
and when I tried to learn,
the latency was high,
the bandwidth low,
and the accuracy poor.

This was itself **another constraint**.
It was a constraint on the _transfer_ of information.
Going back to school every day,
ready to explain everything I'd tried and the suspicions I'd gained
("the game must be bugged!")
is an exciting social experience.

### Aged Out

It would not have come about today,
where the transfer of information is no longer constraining.
Any attempt to find that same information today gives every conversation anyone has ever had about the game,
anywhere on the planet,
in about three seconds.

No one ever gets stuck trying to open Jabu-Jabu's mouth anymore.
By improving the transfer of information's latency, bandwidth, and accuracy concerns,
we've optimized away the imperfect information constraint.
With it goes unique social experience of solving mysteries with friends.

## Messing with the Denominator

What can we fix about this?
In what modern day situation would you _have_ to socialize with friends to get information,
knowing the internet is at your fingertips?
Take a minute before continuing and see if you can workshop a solution.

How do you stop a player from looking something up?

1. Prevent them from knowing there is anything _to_ look up.
2. Drip-feed them outside information.

From Software does this in three ways, and I've

2. Don’t draw attention to it.
3. Make required routes feel optional.

The way to stop a player from looking something up is to stop them from knowing, noticing, or remembering that there is anything _to_ look up.
If Jabu-Jabu was an optional dungeon and it wasn’t apparent you could enter him,
I wouldn’t have a clue I was even missing anything—until a friend exclaims how excited they were to discover it serendipitously.

This is how From Software builds its games:

#### Downplay

Almost everything is optional. This removes the opportunity for the player to know they’re stuck—*maybe it's just a dead end?* Large gameplay areas are hidden behind hard-to-find paths, but you can’t look up how to find it if you don't know it exists.

#### Distract

Every fork in the road leads to two more. Enter a new room only to be greeted with two exits and a ladder. The open world itself is the grand example; even if your goal is required and you know it’s there, you may get swept up in a series of tangential routes and simply forget about it.

#### Disguise

Experienced players-of-game know there are three types of routes you can go down:

1. Required
2. Optional or bonus
3. Not intended

**Required** routes are the big roads, the bridges, the big landmarks in the skybox: The Citadel in Half-Life 2, the street lamps in Alan Wake, and *to the right* in 2D Mario games. These routes go to the next level, next boss, or next story moment.

**Optional** routes contain bonuses for players who take the time to explore: down a pipe, in a side room, or backtracking at a reverse-fork in the road. These routes have bonus items, bonus story content, or collectible.

**Unintended** routes are what folks like speedunners try to find. They are ways to use the game mechanics or geometry to get somewhere you're not supposed to be. Think jumping on an NPC's head to get onto a roof, or landing on small collidable surfaces like the tip of a tree, or [attaching a car to a windmill to extend its jump distance](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/28711958).

Something From Software does better than anyone is **make routes feel unintended**. The way the cities are laid out, the way all the architecture feels like it was made for giants, and the notes players can leave behind all combine to **make you feel like you're getting away with something**, which means all the more in such a difficult game.

#### Conclusion

These three things together have created a magical experience where you stumble upon something major,

TODO: Mention player notes. Very important piece.
