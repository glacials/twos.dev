# Play the Developer, Not the Game

Notes on ways we play the developer, not the game

- Purposefully taking the route that looks like a dead end because there could be side content
- Assuming (until seen otherwise) the game is well-balanced. e.g. a sword with a fast attack speed will have less damage, or (Vampire Survivors) a weapon that shoots multiple projectiles will do less damage per projectile
- Looking for brightly colored ledges to grab/climb
- Knowing that enemies leash, particularly in stealth sections
- Knowing a boss arena when you enter one
- Seeing cover deployed in strategic places and knowing it means enemies are coming (especially in cover shooters)
- Knowing when enemies are infinitely spawning (so have to push through) vs. not (so should clear them out)
- There’s almost always a way forward / out of a dead end; it’s rare that you softlock a game
- What do areas you can’t get to look like
- Enemies often have patterns you can identify and use against them
- iframes exist
- Dying quickly going one way and not realizing “I guess the game doesn’t want me to go that way”
- Invisible walls exist
- Kill planes exist
- Go towards the light
- Triggers
- Dead ends don’t exist (if there’s no loot or way forward in a path, you’ve missed something)
- Linear games
  - Presence of enemies means it’s the right way (even if backtracking geographically)
  - A path being accessible means there’s a reason to take it (vs. saying “hm that doesn’t look like the way I’m going”)
- Knowing rolling means invincibility
- There’s ~always a way out i.e. soft locks are rare
- NPCs aren’t wrong; e.g. in Tears of the Kingdom of someone says “there’s a bubbulfrog in every cave”, there fucking is one even if you can’t find it.
