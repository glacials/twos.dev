# Thoughts From A Star Trek Newbie

I'm very sensitive to spoilers.
I don't want to know if the thing you are recommending to me has a twist,
I don't want to know what it is similar to,
I don't want to know that one season is bad and one is good,
I don't want to know why you like it or whether you like it or what type of person likes it.

These things get in my head and it's all I can think about when watching it.^[Once, a coworker recommended I play through a game. When I told him I would but gave him the above spiel, he told me "I'll only say this: They _didn't_ fuck up time travel." In that moment I winced and told him I really wish he hadn't said that, because now I know the game will involve time travel, and I'll be thinking about that the whole time up until the game reveals it. I played the entire game through. There was no time travel. Sean, you are the only person who can get away with this.]
I've never met or heard about anyone with as deep a sensitivity to spoilers as me.
It's hard to make people understand how small a revelation it takes to negatively impact my experience.

For this reason, I'll usually avoid socializing about something until I'm completely done with it.
But I can appreciate that some people enjoy hearing my thoughts about content they get really excited about.

So I've started this page. I am watching through _all_ of Star Trek and post my thoughts on it below.
I'm doing this on my website so that people don't reply to me.

## I Do Not Want Answers To These Questions

Not until I've caught up.

### Star Trek

1. Why are the most crucial people to the operation of the ship the same ones that are constantly leaving the ship on missions?

### Star Trek: The Next Generation

1. In season 3 finale, the Borg go specifically after Picard for assimilation, not other starship captains. Why? Sure they had encountered him before in their home territory, but why does that matter?
2. Why is the Federation of Planets and the Enterprise crew primarily human?
3. Why do they continue to have little-to-no security controls, blast doors, or quarantine procedures on the Enterprise despite obvious need?
   1. Once it was said (by Kirk or Picard, I don’t remember) that they have no need for such controls because they can trust everyone on the ship. This is obviously false, it seems like every fifth episode involves something bad that could have been stopped with standard physical digital security.
4. How do the communicators work? Voice activated? Doesn’t add up. How do they know when to cut off? People frequently stop talking to their communicator and start talking to someone next to them without a significant pause.
5. What does a video call with the Enterprise look like? In S4E4, Picard talks on a video call from all the way back by the Turbolift. Is there auto-tracking? If yes, why don't we ever see any?
6. What’s the experience like when the Enterprise mutes your video call to discuss things amongst themselves?
7. How does “come in” after a doorbell chime work? Is it recognized by the computer? Or does the person hear it and enter of their own authority?
8. What does “supplementary” mean in log entries?
9. What happened to the human child Worf ~adopted because his mother died on a mission he was leading?
10. If Transporter Chief O’Brian was previously a tactical officer, why is he a Transporter Chief now? It seems like a different skillset.
11. What is the disadvantage of higher warp?
12. Why do remote calls just cut out without hearing “end call” or seeing the person reach for a button to disconnect the call?
13. Why do transporters send folks to other transporter rooms when available, but can actually transport anywhere? Is it less power to go transporter-to-transporter?
14. How do communicators know what words to transmit? TNG S5E15 Troi speaks through Worf’s transmitter (while it is on Worf’s person) without having her own and it works.
15. In S5E17 Riker tells Deanna that he is entering a romantic relationship with Soren (sp?) and then they kiss on the mouth. I’m down with it. But did I miss something, are they in a casual relationship now? Are they still together and poly? Is mouth kissing common between friends?
16. My favorite episode so far is where Picard falls asleep and lives a whole life as a memory of a civilization from star system Kataan (sp?).
17. They have so many holodeck malfunctions that cause danger, shouldn’t they add some more safeguards?

### Star Trek: Depp Space 9

1. Season 1 is _really bad_.
   1. It feels like the early seasons of Stargate SG-1. Takes itself so seriously but the plots are so shallow
   2. Sisko feels like an actor, not a character.
2. Why don’t ships just start beaming enemy ships' crew off their ships when the enemy ship's shields are down?
3. Okay season 2 is getting good. I liked the episode when O'brien came back to the station to find everyone treating him weirdly.
