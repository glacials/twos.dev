  <h1>The Ben Carlsson User Guide</h1>

  <p>May 2021</p>

  <p>
    This page describes my working and communication styles [1].
  </p>

  <p>
    We are all different and each have our preferences. The below points are not
    demands, but ways to reduce friction with me. Use or ignore at your
    discretion :)
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Be concise.</b> Most ideas can fit in a tweet. Most specs can fit on a
      page. I dump my unfiltered thoughts into my keyboard then spend most of my
      "writing" time deleting. For example, this bullet's first draft was three
      paragraphs.
      <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html">More</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Prefer sharing vision over coordinating.</b> Coordination is slow. If
      we sync on where we're going rather than on how to get there, we will each
      be empowered to make decisions while in motion, instead of being blocked.
      And if we are good about sharing what we've learned in nonblocking ways
      like demos and email blasts, we can spread knowledge all the same [2].
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Prefer non-interruptive communication.</b> A five-second Slack
      conversation can set my brain back 30 minutes. Similarly, the best time to
      schedule a meeting with me is immediately before or after another meeting.

    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Prefer talking in the ticket.</b> As a forgetful person I love
      single-origin paper trails.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Think in customer problems.</b> Even if &lt;product&gt; "feels right"
      be prepared for me to ask what customer problem it solves. The one
      exception is tech debt, since we all know how it impacts customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Know when it's time to schedule a meeting.</b> Antithetical to many of
      the above, async communication sometimes doesn't fit [3]. If things are
      getting heated, misunderstood, or blocked, throw a meeting on my calendar
      or <a href="thepopin.html">pop in</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Give me feedback!</b> I love feedback. We all feel it's a little bit
      awkward to give feedback and I think that is dumb and you should help me
      break that norm.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Warnings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>I think slowly.</b> Asking me to answer a complex question on the spot
      will be an "I don't know", but over the following minutes my brain will
      sometimes produce the answer. I can accelerate this by asking a flurry of
      questions. This means I'm excited to understand you. If this is stressing
      you out tell me, I don't blame you.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>I go rogue.</b> If I get a burst of motivation I'll sometimes do work
      without tracking it or checking with anyone. This is because I know the
      anxiety of shepharding it through the pipeline will outlast my burst of
      motivation. <a

      of the most loved features i've built have come out of this.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>I work weird hours.</b> Inspiration strikes randomly and sometimes it
      happens to be a sunday or 3am when it does. Sometimes I'm in flow for 12
      hours. To counterbalance I shorten my standard workdays and the math ends
      up working out. However the odd email or commit from me may have a
      timestamp that looks unhealthy.

      [3]: Async communication is great and it should be the default. but
      knowing its flaws and when to switch to sync is important. Async is:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Low bandwidth</b>: Writing doesn't have inflection or body language,
        so you need more words to convey the same idea. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bFsqk84frI">More</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>High latency</b>: An idea that takes 30 back-and-forths to resolve
        may take minutes in a meeting but weeks in writing. Meetings really have
        <i>negative</i> latency because you see people react before you've
        finished speaking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>High effort</b>: Even if you account for low bandwidth and reach the
        same % chance of being understood as when speaking, when that % "misses"
        the cost is high because of the round-trip-time. To counteract this, you
        spend even more time editing than you did getting your meaning across.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Emotional</b>: I perceive people as meaner in writing than in
        meetings, and in response I become meaner. I don't want to and I try not
        to, but it can still happen. (Please call me out on it.)
      </li>
    </ul>
