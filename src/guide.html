  <h1>User Guide</h1>

  <p>May 2021; updated April 2022</p>

  <p>
    This page describes things I value at work [1]. This is descriptive, not
    prescriptive; try to treat this as a set of FYIs, not a set of requirements. Use or
    ignore at your discretion, and share your own guide with me!
  </p>

  <h2>Communication Style</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Succinctness</b>: The more people who will read what you're writing, the higher
      the cost/benefit of spending more time writing it. (For widespread pieces, my
      "writing time" is 90% editing.)
      <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html">More</a>,
      <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html">even more</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Agree on a vision</b>: Coordination is slow. Once we agree on a shared vision,
      it's easier for everyone if we trust (and authorize) each other to make the right
      decisions in motion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Async, by default</b>: A thirty-second interruption can set me back 30 minutes.
      I like to bring more conversations into async things like tickets, pull requests,
      or even audio or video recordings (e.g. <a href="https://loom.com">Loom</a>) when
      I need intonation or body language.
      <a href="https://heeris.id.au/trinkets/ProgrammerInterrupted.png">More</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tickets, by default</b>: As a forgetful person I love single-origin paper
      trails, so add one more point to the "move conversations out of Slack" column.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Speak in customer problems</b>: Even if a solution "feels right" be prepared
      for me to ask what customer problem it solves. The one free pass is tech debt,
      since we all know how it impacts customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Know when to meet</b>: Async communication has its limits [2]. If things are
      getting heated, misunderstood, or blocked, throw a meeting on my calendar or
      <a href="thepopin.html">pop in</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Give unprompted feedback</b>: I love feedback. We all feel it's a little bit
      awkward to give feedback and I think that is dumb and you should help me break
      that norm.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Warnings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>My brain is mostly backburners.</b> I can't usually answer complex questions on
      the spot. I can temporarily get past this by asking a flurry of questions. This
      means I'm excited about the problem, but sometimes stresses people out; see #7
      above :)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>I go rogue.</b> Sometimes I care so much about fixing or building something
      that I'll do it without tracking it, because the overhead is bigger than the job
      itself. Some
      <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglcls%2Fstatus%2F720689621466619904&src=typed_query">loved features</a>
      have come out of having the freedom to do this; see #2 above :)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>I work weird hours.</b> Motivation strikes me randomly. Sometimes that's during
      a workday but sometimes it's on a Sunday or at 4 AM or for 16 hours straight. To
      counterbalance, I shorten my workdays and the math roughly works out. So if you
      see some emails or commits from me with unhealthy-feeling timestamps, just keep in
      mind my default workday is only at ~70% capacity.
    </li>
