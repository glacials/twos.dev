# Android → iPhone

I was initially surprised iPhone and [iPad](tablet.html) lacked feature parity. This first came up trying to swipe-type on iPad. Another is iPad can show multiple apps on the screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay. I felt confused at first, but I see Apple’s angle -- none of these make sense on the other form factor. They’d rather deny you the feature than allow using it to be confusing or unintuitive. Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad because Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.

The more native apps I use on iOS, the better the UX gets. For example, you can use multi-touch to drag-and-drop items between apps. Third-party apps only implement this functionality sometimes.
