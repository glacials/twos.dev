# User Guide

This page describes things I value at work. This is descriptive of me, not
prescriptive to you; treat it as a set of FYIs, not requirements. Use or ignore
at your discretion, and share your own guide with me!

## My Communication Style

1. **Succinct**: The more people who will read what I'm writing, the higher the
   cost/benefit of spending time honing it. For widespread pieces, 90% of my
   time is spent editing. [More](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html), [even
   more](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)
2. **Trusting**: Coordination is slow. Everything is easier if
   we trust and authorize each other to make decisions in motion, rather than
   blocking on consensus. We can continue to share progress in nonblocking
   ways. [More](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/DoOcracy)
3. **Asynchronous by default**: A 30-second interruption sets me back 30 minutes—it's how my brain works. To minimize this I like to have conversations in async
   mediums like tickets, pull requests, and screen recordings.

4. **Ticket-centric**: As a forgetful person I love single-origin paper
   trails. I practice inbox zero so pinging me in a ticket is a more reliable
   way to reach me than Slack.
5. **Customer-focused**: Even if a solution "feels right" be prepared for me to
   ask what customer problem it solves.

## Warnings

-  **My brain is all backburners.** I can't immediately answer complex questions.
   I can temporarily get past this by asking a barrage of questions about the
   question. This means I'm excited about the problem, but sometimes stresses
   people out; tell me if so and I can avoid doing that with you.
-  **I go rogue.** Sometimes I care so much about fixing or building something
   that I'll do it without tracking it, because the overhead—or the emotional
   burden that comes with it—is bigger than the job itself. Some [adored
   features](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fglcls%2Fstatus%2F720689621466619904&src=typed_query)
   have come out of having the freedom to do this; see #2 above :D
-  **I work weird hours.** Motivation strikes me randomly—sometimes during a
   workday but sometimes on a Sunday or at 4 AM or for 16 hours straight. To
   counterbalance, I shorten my workdays and the math roughly works out. So if
   you see emails or commits from me with unhealthy-feeling timestamps, keep in
   mind my default workday is at ~70% capacity.
