# Diagnostics


  


The democratization of the self-awareness of mental health, biases, and impacts of trauma is the biggest advancement of the species since the scientific revolution. Like the scientific method cleaned up [rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) by shining a light on it, we are in a decades-long process of building a similar framework for thinking about problems within ourselves.

  


We will use this framework to correct thoughts that feel correct but aren't. Like the earth felt flat and light felt instant, we are discovering that feeling lazy or overwhelmed is not the whole story. Tools that can dig below those feelings are becoming accessible to the layperson.

  


Many people are afraid of an AI that can diagnose and repair itself, but we haven't even reached that point ourselves. We are self-aware, but not self-diagnostic. We have never had the tools and knowledge to self-critique, check for errors, and repair damage.

  


However, it has happened at a generational scale. Evolution optimizes for continuation of the species. But it sees forest, not trees. Trees are its pawns, each a random experiment, an insurance policy for a hyperspecific disaster. Evolution works slowly.

  


We are building ourselves into a group of trees that can reason, measure, learn, and improve on an _individual_ basis, not just a generational one. We pass those improvements to the next generation as knowledge. Evolution continues its work via genes. We play the micro-game while evolution plays the macro-game.

  


This two-pronged development is the key that will unlock our future as a species. Imagine replaying human history with every bad decision having a 50% chance of being prevented. A would-be bully watches a TikTok about dealing with trauma at home. A bright and "lazy" student catches their ADHD early and goes on to succeed wildly in life. A man raised by patriarchy helps tear it down.
