# 90 > 100

More people should do things at 90% effort. If you believe you can only choose 0% or 100%, youâ€™ll often choose 0% because you cannot afford 100%.

I became very engaged in helping with the climate emergency in the last couple of years. One really big line item on the list of emitters is meat. It takes x CO2 to create one chicken salad. It emits y CO2 if you replace the chicken with tofu.

But there are some things about being vegetarian I just can't do. Summer is deeply carnivorous and I don't want to put her through needing to carve all her options around me (though we did try).

I don't want to be that person in the friend group people have to plan for, or the person who shows up hungry to a barbecue only to make the host feel guilty for not having options.

And there are some formats of meat that I have cravings for once in a blue moon, like a burger or a ball park hot dog.

So I can't be 100% vegetarian. But that's no reason to stay at 0%. I can easily cut meat from the 90% of meals that don't cause any of these issues.

So I became [flexitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/Flexitarianism), which I describe as "vegetarian except when it would inconvenience people". If 90% of the world could become 90% vegetarian the benefit would be nearly that of 100%/100%, but it's probably 1,000x easier to achieve.

I think we need to take this strategy more often in life. It's similar to the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/80-20_rule), but 80/20 is about optimizing bang-for-the-buck when building things. 90 > 100 is about recognizing that `impact per success` is a worse thing to optimize for than `success rate * impact per success`.
