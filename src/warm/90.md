# 90 > 100

More people should do things at 90% effort. If you believe you can only choose 0% or 100%, you’ll often choose 0% because you cannot afford 100%.

I became very engaged in helping with the climate emergency in the last couple of years. One really big line item on the list of emitters is meat. One serving (100 g) of beef emits the equivalent of [15 kg](https://www.co2everything.com/co2e-of/beef) of CO₂ into the atmosphere, the same as driving 78 km (48 mi). One 100 g serving of tofu emits 0.08 kg of CO₂ equivalent.^[CO₂ equivalent ("CO₂e") is how we describe climate change impact in a way agnostic to the method. For example cows emit methane, which impacts the climate in a far greater way than CO₂.] In other words, a week of eating beef emits more CO₂e than three years of eating tofu.^[3x meals daily of 100g protein each]

For someone wanting to reduce emissions, vegetarianism is a clear candidate. But there are some things about being vegetarian I just can't do:

1. Summer is deeply carnivorous and I don't want to put her through the effects of my choice (we did try).
2. I don't want to be that person in the friend group people have to plan around, the person whose presence at a barbecue makes an unprepared host feel guilty.
3. There are formats of meat I get occasional cravings for, like a burger or a ball park hot dog.

I can't be 100% vegetarian. But that's no reason to stay at 0%. I can cut meat from the ~90% of meals that don't cause any of these issues.

So I became [flexitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/Flexitarianism) which for me means "vegetarian except when it would inconvenience people". If 90% of the world could become 90% vegetarian the benefit would be nearly that of 100%/100% but orders of magnitude easier to achieve.

We need to adopt this strategy more. It's similar to the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/80-20_rule), but 80/20 optimizes bang-for-buck when building things. 90 > 100 is about recognizing that `impact per success` is a worse thing to optimize for than `success rate * impact per success`.
