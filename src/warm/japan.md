# The Apple of Countries

- 20:39: Hotel using secured wifi network with no request-intercepting "accept our bullshit" bullshit.
- 12:25: No one crosses on a red crosswalk light
- 16:20: Orderly getting on escalator
- 13:08: When you call an elevator you know immediately which car will pick you  up (immediate feedback on that car's chime and light upon pressing the button). May take longer than lazy selection but it feels better to know where to stand and not have to constantly be on lookout for chime or light.
