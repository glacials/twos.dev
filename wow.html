ASLEEP</a>, which was shared with

<h1>World of Warcraft</h1>

<p>Yeah, you knew it was coming. If you despise <em>World of Warcraft</em> (or MMORPG’s in
general), maybe you should stop reading here if you don’t want to throw up.</p>

<p>I started playing in September 2005, right when I started my job (where both my
coblogger and I still work) because about half of the employees there played
religiously, so I figured, <em>why the hell not</em>.</p>

<p>At that time I had been exploring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">multi-user
dungeons</a>, which are basically text-based
MMORPG’s, but I guess <em>WoW</em> sounded more appealing when everyone got into
talking about it. It was a nice sort of ice-breaker, too <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I’m not a big
initiator of smalltalk, so actually having something real (if you can call it
that ) to talk about was a good way to pass the time.</p>

<p>You could probably view my track record with WoW as a tipsy relationship. You
could say we went out for about six months, but then we got bored of each other
and separated. You could then say we got back together a few months later with
more passion than ever <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I was always bad at sticking to one character, but
during this passion period, I played only my mage for about three or four weeks,
getting him from the mid-30’s to 54 <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> which was the largest spike in our
relationship.</p>

<p>You could also say that once the effects of the spike dwindled away, our
relationship again grew repetitive and boring, so we took another break <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> one
that lasted about two months.</p>

<p>And now, after the serious lows and the serious highs, it’s almost like we’ve
landed right in the middle <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> right at the sweet spot. I like to play it enough
to maintain my characters, but not enough to cut myself off from all the other
good games out there <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it’s an open relationship.</p>

<p>I’ve given up on getting better gear for my 70 (the mage I leveled in such a
hurry for <em>Burning Crusade</em>) because of the upcoming release of <em>Wrath of the
Lich King</em>. Instead I’m just leveling a handful of alts, trying not to rush
through them.</p>

<p>These include an 11 priest, a 32 druid, a 40 warlock (free mounts ftw) all on
the same server.</p>

<p>I would review the game itself instead of my history with it, but reviewing
MMORPG’s is a touchy subject <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> my opinions would probably be way more biased
than usual, and (not even as an affect of that) people would probably exaggerate
the review depending on their attitude towards MMO’s.</p>

<p>And apparently because it’s Christmas, my family and I are going to do family
things like make waffles and play Monopoly. So I should wrap this up.</p>

<p>Blegh.</p>

<p>(not at the waffles <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> waffles are the pwnzage)</p>
