<h1>Fun with hardware (OR: The physical world and you)</h1>

<p>I was right. It <a href="juven2.html">was</a> something stupid.</p>

<p>I had burned Ubuntu onto a DVD and was trying to read it with a CD drive. BLAHG!</p>

<p>So I reburned it and it installed fine. I actually wasn’t expecting that Ubuntu
Server would be as command-line-dependent as it is (no desktop environment
whatsoever), but it makes sense. I’ve just got to look up anything I want to do
at another computer, write it down, then run upstairs and type it in, since my
own computer isn’t at this house and I have to use the family’s.</p>

<p>So far I’ve gotten it hooked up to the ‘net and running Apache, MySQL, PHP and
an FTP server, although I’ve only had the chance to test the FTP server so far.
But before I get too bogged down on getting it all ready-to-go on the software
half, I actually have to <em>get everything in that case.</em></p>

<p>What I did (or am attempting to do) with the case is kinda stupid, actually. I
just took the old case, ripped out the HDD and CDD bays with just a screwdriver
and my now-cut-in-several-places hands, repositioned the former, left out the
latter, and fastened (if you can call it that) the power supply on top of the
bay using a seriously-bent piece of metal and a screw.</p>

<p>In retrospect, all this did was make the final assembly one
power-supply-worth-of-height shorter and give me a computer that was held
together by nothing more than twisted metal and a few of the original screws.
Not to mention, now the power supply is on the <em>other side of the case</em> compared
to the graphics card and motherboard <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> so I’ll end up plugging in the power cord
into the <em>front</em> of the computer.</p>

<p>Talk about deranged.</p>

<p>Oh, and just an update on one of my <a href="realtors.html">previous posts</a>: we never
actually lost a cat like I thought; she was just hiding somewhere. I sure as
hell don’t know <em>where</em>, because I pretty much used all my wallhacks to look for
her, but whatever; she’s here and safe.</p>

<p>I’ll finish off the post with this: almost every day I have a song stuck in my
head (usually a good one). Today it’s Time Warp from the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show">The Rocky Horror
Picture Show</a> (which
was made after a musical containing the same song), and I can’t figure out where
I’ve heard the mini-chorus part of it before, but I have to say, it’s a really
good song, despite its unusual containment in this movie. I just want to get up
and do the dance. It’s kinda weird. But good, too.</p>

<p>But weird.</p>
