But that word, &#34;spectrum&#34;, in that&#xA;  context, has had its meaning lost to time. Often people think of folks with&#xA;  autism as &#34;high functioning&#34; or &#34;low functioning&#34;, as if these are positions&#xA;  on the spectrum. But a spectrum is not a scale. This is how to actually think&#xA;  about the autism spectrum:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;spectrum&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/center&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  There is no &#34;more&#34; or &#34;less&#34;; no &#34;high&#34; or &#34;low&#34;. There is only &#34;different&#34;.&#xA;  And yet people often still feel they&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;know it when they see it&lt;/a&gt;; that people with autism either act like Rain Man or don&#39;t, and that those&#xA;  are the two (if even that many) types of autism.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a&#xA;  glance?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;canary1&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;The Canary Symptom&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same&#xA;  hand.

We&#39;ll come back to&#xA;  that later.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;example&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;A Personal Example&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As&#xA;  cool as it sounds, this is no superpower. My body&#39;s defense systems will&#xA;  sometimes malfunction and miscalibrate incoming volume.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Imagine you&#39;re in a coffee shop reading a book when someone walks up to you,&#xA;  takes out an air horn, points it in your ear and briefly squeezes the trigger.&#xA;  What would your brain and body do instinctively? Would it startle, flinch,&#xA;  recoil? What if the person didn&#39;t go away, and kept squeezing the trigger&#xA;  randomly every few seconds? What if you looked around and slowly realized in&#xA;  horror that everyone else had their own air horn and they have all started&#xA;  doing the same?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Your instinctive responses escalate to stress, panic, confusion. You keep&#xA;  trying to read your book but the air horns keep sounding and your body keeps&#xA;  flinching. You can&#39;t concentrate; your eyes are moving over the words in your&#xA;  book but you&#39;re not understanding them. You start getting annoyed at all the&#xA;  people wielding air horns&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;could they just not?! I&#39;m trying to read!&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is a hearing hypersensitivity. At random times, my brain will think every&#xA;  little sound is as loud as an air horn and it will execute all these&#xA;  physiological responses involuntarily. Even when I know it&#39;s a&#xA;  malfunction&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;which took me 30 years to learn&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it&#39;s still just as hard as ever to&#xA;  get through a paragraph in that book, to not flinch, to not become stressed,&#xA;  to not panic. Even when I can rationally tell myself in the moment&#xA;  &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s all in your head&lt;/i&gt;, it doesn&#39;t stop the involuntary response.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  You may understand then why I and many other people with autism would, as&#xA;  children, collapse to the floor in public, cover their ears, and scream.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;canary2&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Killing the Canary&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  In many ways, I&#39;m one of the lucky ones. I didn&#39;t get dealt that &#34;inability to&#xA;  change behavior based on social feedback&#34; symptom, above. So when as a child I&#xA;  collapsed to the floor and screamed, and other people looked at me like I was&#xA;  losing it (reminder: I was) I can log that detail away, and work a little more&#xA;  towards avoiding it next time. I&#39;ve iterated on this quite a bit over 30&#xA;  years:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;On the floor screaming&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Ears covered, eyes shut, silent&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;On the floor cross-legged, teeth gritted, trying to dissociate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Fingers-in-ears, screaming interally&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Inventing excuses to stay home&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Going home&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same.&#xA;  During a hearing hypersensitivity, inside I&#39;m still that kid rolling on the&#xA;  floor screaming. The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;canary3&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;When the Canary Lives&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  People dealt the &#34;inability to change behavior based on social feedback&#34; card&#xA;  get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what&#xA;  the world thinks autism &#34;looks like&#34;; the canary symptom that reveals the&#xA;  rest.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  The people with this symptom, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking&#xA;  it, often need more support because our world is not built to accomodate them&#xA;  or understand them well. But they are not any more &#34;low-functioning&#34; than I am&#xA;  &#34;high-functioning&#34;. Those words are descriptions of how &lt;em&gt;observers&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;  experience autism, not how autism-havers do. That&#39;s why those terms have&#xA;  fallen out of use since the DSM-5.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;masking&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;Masking&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This ability to fake not having autism is called &lt;b&gt;masking&lt;/b&gt;. Those of us&#xA;  who can mask&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;those without the canary symptom&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;mask in virtually every social&#xA;  situation.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is not a temporary &#34;get to know me and I&#39;ll stop masking&#34; deal; I mask in&#xA;  front of my mom, and Summer, and even my psychologist. It&#39;s like an emulation&#xA;  layer that sits on top of my brain so I can run programs that let me&#xA;  communicate with others, programs like &#34;talking&#34; and &#34;facial expressions&#34; and&#xA;  &#34;not losing it&#34;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It&#39;s not that I feel forced to do these things. I am a human being, so I crave&#xA;  social interaction. I love my friends and family and I enjoy interacting with&#xA;  them, and this is how I have to do it. I just wish we ran the same&#xA;  architecture, because masking is&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;exhausting&lt;/em&gt; [2]. My brain overclocks itself just running this&#xA;  emulation layer. It reallocates important resources from other programs like&#xA;  reason and problem-solving. I literally become dumber when I am with others.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every&#xA;  day is &#34;unmasking&#34;, which I&#39;d equate to the feeling of getting home from a&#xA;  long trip and flopping down on your own bed. Masking is a great tool and being&#xA;  able to use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;extra toll&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;radar&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Flying Under the Radar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  One risk of masking is going your whole life undiagnosed. You don&#39;t have to&#xA;  know you&#39;re masking to mask. Historically most autism diagnoses are in&#xA;  children, which is no coincidence&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;if you happen to slip past childhood without&#xA;  a diagnosis, chances are good that you&#39;re old enough to have learned masking,&#xA;  which can hide your autism forever. I narrowly avoided this fate. I missed&#xA;  diagnosis during my childhood window and it was 30 years until my eventual&#xA;  adult diagnosis, which happened more by chance than anything.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It sounds silly in retrospect to spend so much effort masking and dealing with&#xA;  other issues without realizing that other people don&#39;t, but it&#39;s difficult to&#xA;  identify atypicality when you&#39;ve only ever piloted one brain.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;selfcheck&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;The Rough Self-Check&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Medical help is the best way to find answers. But in the real world not&#xA;  everybody has access to it due to things like family, income, benefits, or&#xA;  location. It&#39;s therefore common to find people in the autism community who&#xA;  identify as self-diagnosed; they are pretty sure they have some form of autism&#xA;  based on how well others&#39; stories resonate with them, but they&#39;re either&#xA;  unwilling or unable to confirm that with a medical professional.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Even for those who are willing and able, going from ignorance to &#34;Oh! That&#xA;  happens to me too!&#34; is often the kick-start needed to seek professional&#xA;  attention. Therefore I present for your benefit a small list of&#xA;  non-professional, non-medical autism indicators that may warrant, at minimum,&#xA;  further investigation:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&#xA;    Occasional or constant annoyance at typically unannoying things like touch,&#xA;    light, or sound (sensory hypersensitivies)&#xA;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&#xA;    More than your peers, a need to dig into what people say by asking&#xA;    clarifying questions (difficulty dealing with ambiguity)&#xA;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Eliminating all facial expression when exiting a room (masking)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;More confusion about social conventions than your peers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  If these resonate with you, consider it a starting point to slingshot yourself&#xA;  into more research and, if available to you, seek a professional.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;More People than You Think&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Two percent of people have autism. There is no &#34;high-functioning&#34; or&#xA;  &#34;low-functioning&#34; autism, because autism is a deck of cards full of symptoms,&#xA;  and each hand is different. One possible symptom is a canary that reveals the&#xA;  others, but not everybody has this symptom. For those who don&#39;t, there is a&#xA;  different set of challenges, often had in private and unfortunately, often&#xA;  taken to the grave.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Be open about your own brain: what does it do well? What does it do poorly?&#xA;  Like sharing salary information, we can&#39;t know what our situation is until we&#xA;  normalize talking about it.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Because really, truly, the best part of my autism journey was just finding&#xA;  out.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;picture&gt;&#xA;    &lt;source srcset=&#34;img/autism-diagnosis-dark.png&#34; media=&#34;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&#34;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;img/autism-diagnosis-light.png&#34; style=&#34;width: 50em; max-width: 100%&#34;/&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/picture&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;footer&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&#xA;    [1]:&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&#xA;    [2]:&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking#effects&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking#effects&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i&gt;&#xA;      Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jm.dev&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jordan McQueen&lt;/a&gt; for&#xA;      early feedback on drafts of this.&#xA;    &lt;/i&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/footer&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

  I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical.
  I have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and
  fighting climate change. I don't need support from others on a daily basis.

  psychology, wrote it right there on my medical chart:

<p>
  It's also the me who was taught that all these qualities are just character

  You'd never notice that me, because I hide him well. Of the folks with autism,
  I'm not an outlier in doing that. In fact, 2% of all human beings have autism
  [1]. Statistically, you've certainly met several of them without realizing it.
  Why is that, and what is it like to live that life?
</p>
<a name="spectrum">
  <h2>The Infamous Spectrum</h2>
</a>
<p>
  We've all heard "autism is a spectrum". But that word, "spectrum", in that
  context, has had its meaning lost to time. Often people think of folks with
  autism as "high functioning" or "low functioning", as if these are positions
  on the spectrum. But a spectrum is not a scale. This is how to actually think
  about the autism spectrum:
</p>
<p>
  </p><center>
    <div class="spectrum"> </div>
  </center>
<p></p>
<p>
  There is no "more" or "less"; no "high" or "low". There is only "different".
  And yet people often still feel they
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it" target="_blank">know it when they see it</a>; that people with autism either act like Rain Man or don't, and that those
  are the two (if even that many) types of autism.
</p>
<p>
  What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a
  glance?
</p>
<a name="canary1">
  <h2>The Canary Symptom</h2>
</a>
<p>
  Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same
  hand. Of the many, the DSM-5 calls out a few examples:
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">
  <p>
    Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships,
    ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various
    social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making
    friends; to absence of interest in peers.
  </p>
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html" target="_blank">DSM-5</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Pay special attention to that first example, which I'll paraphrase as
  "inability to change behavior based on social feedback". We'll come back to
  that later.
</p>
<a name="example">
  <h3>A Personal Example</h3>
</a>
<p>
  One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As
  cool as it sounds, this is no superpower. My body's defense systems will
  sometimes malfunction and miscalibrate incoming volume.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you're in a coffee shop reading a book when someone walks up to you,
  takes out an air horn, points it in your ear and briefly squeezes the trigger.
  What would your brain and body do instinctively? Would it startle, flinch,
  recoil? What if the person didn't go away, and kept squeezing the trigger
  randomly every few seconds? What if you looked around and slowly realized in
  horror that everyone else had their own air horn and they have all started
  doing the same?
</p>
<p>
  Your instinctive responses escalate to stress, panic, confusion. You keep
  trying to read your book but the air horns keep sounding and your body keeps
  flinching. You can't concentrate; your eyes are moving over the words in your
  book but you're not understanding them. You start getting annoyed at all the
  people wielding air horns<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span><i>could they just not?! I'm trying to read!</i>
</p>
<p>
  This is a hearing hypersensitivity. At random times, my brain will think every
  little sound is as loud as an air horn and it will execute all these
  physiological responses involuntarily. Even when I know it's a
  malfunction<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>which took me 30 years to learn<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it's still just as hard as ever to
  get through a paragraph in that book, to not flinch, to not become stressed,
  to not panic. Even when I can rationally tell myself in the moment
  <i>It's all in your head</i>, it doesn't stop the involuntary response.
</p>
<p>
  You may understand then why I and many other people with autism would, as
  children, collapse to the floor in public, cover their ears, and scream.
</p>
<a name="canary2">
  <h3>Killing the Canary</h3>
</a>
<p>
  In many ways, I'm one of the lucky ones. I didn't get dealt that "inability to
  change behavior based on social feedback" symptom, above. So when as a child I
  collapsed to the floor and screamed, and other people looked at me like I was
  losing it (reminder: I was) I can log that detail away, and work a little more
  towards avoiding it next time. I've iterated on this quite a bit over 30
  years:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the floor screaming</li>
  <li>Ears covered, eyes shut, silent</li>
  <li>On the floor cross-legged, teeth gritted, trying to dissociate</li>
  <li>Fingers-in-ears, screaming interally</li>
  <li>Inventing excuses to stay home</li>
  <li>Going home</li>
</ol>
<p>
  My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same.
  During a hearing hypersensitivity, inside I'm still that kid rolling on the
  floor screaming. The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.
</p>
<a name="canary3">
  <h3>When the Canary Lives</h3>
</a>
<p>
  People dealt the "inability to change behavior based on social feedback" card
  get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what
  the world thinks autism "looks like"; the canary symptom that reveals the
  rest.
</p>
<p>
  The people with this symptom, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking
  it, often need more support because our world is not built to accomodate them
  or understand them well. But they are not any more "low-functioning" than I am
  "high-functioning". Those words are descriptions of how <em>observers</em>
  experience autism, not how autism-havers do. That's why those terms have
  fallen out of use since the DSM-5.
</p>
<a name="masking">
  <h2>Masking</h2>
</a>
<p>
  This ability to fake not having autism is called <b>masking</b>. Those of us
  who can mask<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>those without the canary symptom<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>mask in virtually every social
  situation.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a temporary "get to know me and I'll stop masking" deal; I mask in
  front of my mom, and Summer, and even my psychologist. It's like an emulation
  layer that sits on top of my brain so I can run programs that let me
  communicate with others, programs like "talking" and "facial expressions" and
  "not losing it".
</p>
<p>
  It's not that I feel forced to do these things. I am a human being, so I crave
  social interaction. I love my friends and family and I enjoy interacting with
  them, and this is how I have to do it. I just wish we ran the same
  architecture, because masking is
  <em>exhausting</em> [2]. My brain overclocks itself just running this
  emulation layer. It reallocates important resources from other programs like
  reason and problem-solving. I literally become dumber when I am with others.
</p>
<p>
  For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every
  day is "unmasking", which I'd equate to the feeling of getting home from a
  long trip and flopping down on your own bed. Masking is a great tool and being
  able to use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" target="_blank">extra toll</a>.
</p>
<a name="radar">
  <h3>Flying Under the Radar</h3>
</a>
<p>
  One risk of masking is going your whole life undiagnosed. You don't have to
  know you're masking to mask. Historically most autism diagnoses are in
  children, which is no coincidence<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>if you happen to slip past childhood without
  a diagnosis, chances are good that you're old enough to have learned masking,
  which can hide your autism forever. I narrowly avoided this fate. I missed
  diagnosis during my childhood window and it was 30 years until my eventual
  adult diagnosis, which happened more by chance than anything.
</p>
<p>
  It sounds silly in retrospect to spend so much effort masking and dealing with
  other issues without realizing that other people don't, but it's difficult to
  identify atypicality when you've only ever piloted one brain.
</p>
<a name="selfcheck">
  <h3>The Rough Self-Check</h3>
</a>
<p>
  Medical help is the best way to find answers. But in the real world not
  everybody has access to it due to things like family, income, benefits, or
  location. It's therefore common to find people in the autism community who
  identify as self-diagnosed; they are pretty sure they have some form of autism
  based on how well others' stories resonate with them, but they're either
  unwilling or unable to confirm that with a medical professional.
</p>
<p>
  Even for those who are willing and able, going from ignorance to "Oh! That
  happens to me too!" is often the kick-start needed to seek professional
  attention. Therefore I present for your benefit a small list of
  non-professional, non-medical autism indicators that may warrant, at minimum,
  further investigation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Occasional or constant annoyance at typically unannoying things like touch,
    light, or sound (sensory hypersensitivies)
  </li>
  <li>
    More than your peers, a need to dig into what people say by asking
    clarifying questions (difficulty dealing with ambiguity)
  </li>
  <li>Eliminating all facial expression when exiting a room (masking)</li>
  <li>More confusion about social conventions than your peers</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If these resonate with you, consider it a starting point to slingshot yourself
  into more research and, if available to you, seek a professional.
</p>
<a name="conclusion">
  <h2>More People than You Think</h2>
</a>
<p>
  Two percent of people have autism. There is no "high-functioning" or
  "low-functioning" autism, because autism is a deck of cards full of symptoms,
  and each hand is different. One possible symptom is a canary that reveals the
  others, but not everybody has this symptom. For those who don't, there is a
  different set of challenges, often had in private and unfortunately, often
  taken to the grave.
</p>
<p>
  Be open about your own brain: what does it do well? What does it do poorly?
  Like sharing salary information, we can't know what our situation is until we
  normalize talking about it.
</p>
<p>
  Because really, truly, the best part of my autism journey was just finding
  out.

(source:&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/S0k2oSu-nSo?t=267&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  The &lt;i&gt;Assassin&#39;s Creed II&lt;/i&gt; trilogy resolved some shortcomings and took&#xA;  some more risks.

They had invented the&#xA;  perfect cow, and now they could sell milk.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  The games started looking like yearly sports games. Ubisoft announced proudly&#xA;  that it had spun up a second &lt;i&gt;Assassin&#39;s Creed&lt;/i&gt; team so they could trade&#xA;  off releases every year. Wow!

They were&#xA;  meticulously crafted time sinks, just barely fun enough to keep playing.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is the fast food industry of gaming. Cold, calculating,&#xA;  efficient&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;and effective! Assassin&#39;s Creed games are wildly successful&#xA;  because of this strategy. But it overlooks one thing.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loyalty&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  People catch on. They realize they&#39;re being sated, but not satisfied. It might&#xA;  take one game, or two, or ten, but eventually people silently stop bothering&#xA;  to keep buying the games.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  The opposite of this strategy is Nintendo. Nintendo doesn&#39;t give a shit. They&#xA;  love making amazing games, data be damned.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  They take risks, they do weird stuff, and it sometimes flops. But they never&#xA;  milk the cow. The Wii U was a flop. Jumping around your living room to play&#xA;  Wii was a flop. But they weren&#39;t mistakes. Each of them was a step towards the&#xA;  Switch.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-item&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img alt=&#34;A marketing photo of a family playing Wii together.&#34; src=&#34;/img/gut-wii.jpg&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;i style=&#34;display: block; text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Nintendo&#39;s family vision for the Wii never took off like they wanted.

The control stick. The 3D&#xA;  platformer. The twin-stick first-person shooter. The&#xA;  &lt;i&gt;home video game system&lt;/i&gt;. The handheld console. The open-world adventure&#xA;  game. The metroidvania. Where would the video game industry be if Nintendo&#xA;  milked their cows?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Ubisoft and Nintendo are both successful companies by many measures, so it&#39;s&#xA;  hard to point at them and say &#34;I like this one better, so the other one must&#xA;  be flawed&#34;. Any company as successful as Ubisoft must have done many things&#xA;  right, and far be it from me to tell them their philosophy is wrong.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  But as someone with a couple of successful products, it&#39;s important for me to&#xA;  make sure my philosophy is in tune with my ideals.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  I want to be like Nintendo. And I don&#39;t know for sure to what extent they use&#xA;  data, but anyone who&#39;s interacted with their software a lot knows it&#39;s at&#xA;  least an order of magnitude less than a traditional tech company.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A Personal Aside&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  I chose Nintendo as an example here because I like them. I line up about 18&#xA;  hours before any home Nintendo console launches. It&#39;s chill, with people&#xA;  passing cocoa, playing guitar, and being thankful Nintendo console launches&#xA;  don&#39;t yield near-death experiences and eBay scalpers like other console&#xA;  launches.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-item&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img alt=&#34;A long but calm line of people waiting outside an EB Games, busy with their various devices.&#34; src=&#34;/img/gut-wiilaunch.jpg&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;i style=&#34;display: block; text-align: center&#34;&gt;The chillest crowd. (source:&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/12437/los-angeles-wii-launch-report&#34; class=&#34;text-muted&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nintendo World Report&lt;/a&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It was this chillfolk vibe for the Gamecube, the Nintendo DS, and the Wii. But&#xA;  for the Wii U, something was different. No one else showed up. I sat alone in&#xA;  the dark all night. An unseen concerned citizen, presumably an employee not&#xA;  knowing why I was there, called the cops on me. By the time the doors opened,&#xA;  only nine people had lined up, all after sunrise.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  At those wee hours into the night, staving off sleep with excitement and hot&#xA;  cocoa, I remember thinking&#xA;  &lt;i&gt;Where is everybody? Did I get the date right?&lt;/i&gt;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  I did. There was no one there because the Wii U was horribly marketed (&#34;So&#xA;  it&#39;s an add-on for Wii?&#34;) and had no launch games worth buying one for.&#xA;  Nintendo failed me. I&#39;d done what superfans do: I gave my heart, my time, and&#xA;  my money, and it was all a big let-down.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t care. Look at this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;center&gt;&lt;code&gt; ----------------------------------- &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  That&#39;s my loyalty bar towards Nintendo before the Wii U. Now look at this:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;center&gt;&lt;code&gt; ----------------------------- &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  That&#39;s my loyalty bar towards Nintendo after the Wii U. Only a handful of&#xA;  brands in my life can take a hit like that. &lt;i&gt;Assassin&#39;s Creed&lt;/i&gt; certainly&#xA;  isn&#39;t one of them.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Nintendo and Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Nintendo takes crazy risks based on what sometimes feel like acid trip ideas.&#xA;  Think about the premise of Animal Crossing for a second.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-item&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img alt=&#34;A meme comic where a racoon asks a stranger to buy a house.&#34; src=&#34;/img/gut-animalcrossing.jpg&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;i style=&#34;display: block; text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;  The premise of Animal Crossing. (source:&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/77tg02/a_n_i_m_a_l_c_r_o_s_s_i_n_g/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  You can&#39;t make this up by looking at data, but it worked, and it filled&#xA;  loyalty bars. These bars aren&#39;t exposed in data, at least not until a lifetime&#xA;  of it passes you by. But everyone has one.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Bad decisions can reflect well on the data while still being bad decisions. If&#xA;  you make it impossible for users to cancel their subscriptions, will fewer&#xA;  users cancel their subscriptions? Probably! Does that mean you should do it?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Being data-driven is hard. Adding instrumentation and A/B tests, along with&#xA;  extra specs, coordination, and maintenance takes a lot of time that could be&#xA;  spent building.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Try making the 80/20 trade-off. Put an analytics snippet in your footer or&#xA;  whatever the trend is nowadays. But ditch the experiments framework,&#xA;  scaffolding, headache, and personpower in exchange for a 10x velocity on&#xA;  gut-driven features.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Hard-to-measure things like loyalty bars defy the charts, but are at least as&#xA;  important as them. If you one day discovered users just wanted to be charmed&#xA;  and feel butterflies, wouldn&#39;t you charm them and build butterflies?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-item&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img alt=&#34;A monochromatic illustration of a butterfly.&#34; src=&#34;/img/gut-butterfly.svg&#34; style=&#34;width: 10rem&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re unconvinced, run an A/B test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

  Data-driven decisions are based entirely on proxies, so it can be hard to
  grasp exactly how much influences them behind the scenes. Let's walk through
  an example: <i>Assassin's Creed</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The first <i>Assassin's Creed</i> was a risky move for a game developer: a new
  team building the entire game on new technology in a new genre. It was not
  perfect, but the risk paid off.

  The <i>Assassin's Creed II</i> trilogy resolved some shortcomings and took
  some more risks. That's what sequels to risky games are meant to do; see also
  <i>Portal 2</i>.
</p>
<p>

  because of this strategy. But it overlooks one thing.
</p>
<h2>Loyalty</h2>
<p>
  People catch on. They realize they're being sated, but not satisfied. It might
  take one game, or two, or ten, but eventually people silently stop bothering
  to keep buying the games.
</p>
<p>
  The opposite of this strategy is Nintendo. Nintendo doesn't give a shit. They
  love making amazing games, data be damned.
</p>
<p>
  They take risks, they do weird stuff, and it sometimes flops. But they never
  milk the cow. The Wii U was a flop. Jumping around your living room to play
  Wii was a flop. But they weren't mistakes. Each of them was a step towards the
  Switch.
</p>

  Nintendo's family vision for the Wii never took off like they wanted. (source:

</i>

<p>
  For every mistake, Nintendo gets something right. The control stick. The 3D
  platformer. The twin-stick first-person shooter. The
  <i>home video game system</i>. The handheld console. The open-world adventure
  game. The metroidvania. Where would the video game industry be if Nintendo
  milked their cows?
</p>
<p>
  Ubisoft and Nintendo are both successful companies by many measures, so it's
  hard to point at them and say "I like this one better, so the other one must
  be flawed". Any company as successful as Ubisoft must have done many things
  right, and far be it from me to tell them their philosophy is wrong.
</p>
<p>
  But as someone with a couple of successful products, it's important for me to
  make sure my philosophy is in tune with my ideals.
</p>
<p>
  I want to be like Nintendo. And I don't know for sure to what extent they use
  data, but anyone who's interacted with their software a lot knows it's at
  least an order of magnitude less than a traditional tech company.
</p>
<h3>A Personal Aside</h3>
<p>
  I chose Nintendo as an example here because I like them. I line up about 18
  hours before any home Nintendo console launches. It's chill, with people
  passing cocoa, playing guitar, and being thankful Nintendo console launches
  don't yield near-death experiences and eBay scalpers like other console
  launches.
</p>

<div class="gallery-item">
  <img alt="A long but calm line of people waiting outside an EB Games, busy with their various devices." src="/img/gut-wiilaunch.jpg"/>
</div>

<i style="display: block; text-align: center">The chillest crowd. (source:
  <a href="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/12437/los-angeles-wii-launch-report" class="text-muted" target="_blank">Nintendo World Report</a>)
</i>

<p>
  It was this chillfolk vibe for the Gamecube, the Nintendo DS, and the Wii. But
  for the Wii U, something was different. No one else showed up. I sat alone in
  the dark all night. An unseen concerned citizen, presumably an employee not
  knowing why I was there, called the cops on me. By the time the doors opened,
  only nine people had lined up, all after sunrise.
</p>
<p>
  At those wee hours into the night, staving off sleep with excitement and hot
  cocoa, I remember thinking
  <i>Where is everybody? Did I get the date right?</i>.
</p>
<p>
  I did. There was no one there because the Wii U was horribly marketed ("So
  it's an add-on for Wii?") and had no launch games worth buying one for.
  Nintendo failed me. I'd done what superfans do: I gave my heart, my time, and
  my money, and it was all a big let-down.
</p>
<p>I don't care. Look at this:</p>
<center><code> ----------------------------------- </code></center>
<p>
  That's my loyalty bar towards Nintendo before the Wii U. Now look at this:
</p>
<center><code> ----------------------------- </code></center>
<p>
  That's my loyalty bar towards Nintendo after the Wii U. Only a handful of
  brands in my life can take a hit like that. <i>Assassin's Creed</i> certainly
  isn't one of them.
</p>
<h4>Nintendo and Risks</h4>
<p>
  Nintendo takes crazy risks based on what sometimes feel like acid trip ideas.
  Think about the premise of Animal Crossing for a second.
</p>

<div class="gallery-item">
  <img alt="A meme comic where a racoon asks a stranger to buy a house." src="/img/gut-animalcrossing.jpg"/>
</div>

<i style="display: block; text-align: center">
  The premise of Animal Crossing. (source:
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/77tg02/a_n_i_m_a_l_c_r_o_s_s_i_n_g/" target="_blank">reddit</a>)
</i>
<p>
  You can't make this up by looking at data, but it worked, and it filled
  loyalty bars. These bars aren't exposed in data, at least not until a lifetime
  of it passes you by. But everyone has one.
</p>
<p>
  Bad decisions can reflect well on the data while still being bad decisions. If
  you make it impossible for users to cancel their subscriptions, will fewer
  users cancel their subscriptions? Probably! Does that mean you should do it?
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Being data-driven is hard. Adding instrumentation and A/B tests, along with
  extra specs, coordination, and maintenance takes a lot of time that could be
  spent building.
</p>
<p>
  Try making the 80/20 trade-off. Put an analytics snippet in your footer or
  whatever the trend is nowadays. But ditch the experiments framework,
  scaffolding, headache, and personpower in exchange for a 10x velocity on
  gut-driven features.
</p>
<p>
  Hard-to-measure things like loyalty bars defy the charts, but are at least as
  important as them. If you one day discovered users just wanted to be charmed
  and feel butterflies, wouldn't you charm them and build butterflies?
</p>

<div class="gallery-item">
  <img alt="A monochromatic illustration of a butterfly." src="/img/gut-butterfly.svg" style="width: 10rem"/>
</div>

<p>If you're unconvinced, run an A/B test.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body>

<h2>Photography</h2>

<p>Every December, I challenge myself to concentrate the harvest of photos I take during the calendar year<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>each year's more bountiful than the last's<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>into a dense 13-photo album.</p>

<p>I've just selected and published the photos from 2023.
See them at <a href="/photos.html">photos.html</a>.</p>

<p>My photography gear this year has been the
<a href="https://amzn.to/47nR3a9" target="_blank">Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III</a>
with the
<a href="https://amzn.to/48im3IS" target="_blank">14<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>150mm <span style="font-family: sans-serif">ƒ</span>4.0</a>
as my everyday carry / daytime lens, and the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3vaUaUT" target="_blank">17mm</a>,
<a href="https://amzn.to/3tv8Eyj" target="_blank">25mm</a>,
and
<a href="https://amzn.to/3NATgXT" target="_blank">45mm</a>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif">ƒ</span>1.8 lenses for low-light.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>In 2023, Summer and I were fortunate enough to go to
France,
Japan,
and China.</p>

<p>I've never been a traveler.
I bond with this style:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I spend most of the day psyching myself up to do one thing<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>visit a museum, perhaps<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and the rest of the day recovering from the only event on my itinerary.</p>

<p><em><span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>John Green, <a href="https://amzn.to/3Tzrdff" target="_blank">The Anthropocene Reviewed</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it was not entirely surprising to discover this year that Summer and I enjoy spending 4<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>7 days in one city and dwelling,
with at least half of those days planless,
then going home.</p>

<h2>Interior Design</h2>

<p>I continue my interior design hobby in the background,
but improvement comes slowly.
I discovered <a href="https://www.sweethome3d.com" target="_blank">Sweet Home 3D</a> this year,
which has helped me visualize options quickly.
I've learned to not be picky about furniture visualizations.</p>

<p>We expect to move in 2024,
so I have been playing around with ideas.
I hope to share more later in the year.</p>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do more things at 90% effort. If you believe you can only choose 0% or 100%, you’ll&#xA;often choose 0% because you cannot afford 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I became very engaged in helping with the climate emergency in the last couple of years. One big line item on the list of emitters is meat. A 100g serving of beef emits the equivalent of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.co2everything.com/co2e-of/beef&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;15kg&lt;/a&gt; of CO₂ into the atmosphere, the same as driving 78km (48mi). A 100g serving of tofu emits 0.08 kg of CO₂ equivalent.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:CO-equivalent-CO&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:CO-equivalent-CO&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, a week of eating beef emits more CO₂e than three years of eating tofu.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3x-meals-daily-o&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3x-meals-daily-o&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For someone wanting to reduce emissions, vegetarianism is a clear candidate. But there are some things about being vegetarian I can&#39;t do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Summer is deeply carnivorous and I don&#39;t want to put her through the effects of my choice (we did try).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t want to be that person in the friend group people have to plan around, the person whose presence at a barbecue makes an unprepared host feel guilty.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are formats of meat I get occasional cravings for, like a burger or a ball park hot dog.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t be 100% vegetarian. But that&#39;s no reason to stay at 0%. I can cut meat from the ~90% of meals that don&#39;t cause any of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I became &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexitarianism&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;flexitarian&lt;/a&gt; which for me means &#34;vegetarian except when it would inconvenience people&#34;. If 90% of the world could become 90% vegetarian the benefit would be nearly that of 100%/100% but orders of magnitude easier to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We need to adopt this strategy more. It&#39;s similar to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/80-20_rule&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;80/20 rule&lt;/a&gt;, but 80/20 optimizes bang-for-buck when building things. 90 &amp;gt; 100 is about recognizing that &lt;code&gt;impact per success&lt;/code&gt; is a worse thing to optimize for than &lt;code&gt;success rate * impact per success&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:CO-equivalent-CO&#34;&gt;CO₂ equivalent (&#34;CO₂e&#34;) is how we describe climate change impact in a way agnostic to the method. For example cows emit methane, which impacts the climate in a far greater way than CO₂.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3x-meals-daily-o&#34;&gt;3x meals daily of 100g protein each&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

The usual suspects sure&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;Gmail,&#xA;Photos, Chrome, etc.&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;but also the ones people stay away from&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;Tasks, Keep,&#xA;YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp;amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We&#xA;have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook,&#xA;the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the&#xA;“Google graveyard”. And for a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture&#xA;with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it&#39;s no surprise I’ve&#xA;been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is&#xA;how I understand why&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;or whether&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;I prefer what I chose. For Android, that&#xA;means trialing an iPhone. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&amp;amp;t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I did&#xA;this&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;five years ago for a few months (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://bensw.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bensw&lt;/a&gt;), but&#xA;afterwards I thought &#34;It&#39;s actually not that different, it&#39;s just that the&#xA;Google apps don&#39;t feel native, so I’ll stick with Android&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&#39;ve realized it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition&#xA;without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the same reason Google apps&#xA;don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn&#39;t shine if you only use Google apps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an honest,&#xA;holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me out, but better to&#xA;trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know&#xA;one. These are my notes on hopping the fence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Broad Themes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I&#39;ll summarize&#xA;the themes I&#39;ve witnessed during them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;safety&#34;&gt;Safety vs. Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I&#39;d long ago published its&#xA;Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding denial after denial.&#xA;I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user, and I could see with fresh&#xA;eyes the effects of the strictness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating system. They&#xA;don&#39;t feel like they were written by others, and that makes me feel safe. My&#xA;data feels like part of my device, not part of Google. And I trust my device&#xA;to manage my payment, location, etc. data, because it is mine. I own it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight for it.&#xA;But it&#39;s a good feeling. And it only comes with control&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;control by a&#xA;representative I trust, over parties I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know app developers,&#xA;especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through them I can trust app&#xA;developers, but only because Apple so heavily controls what they can publish.&#xA;They can&#39;t send me to their sketchy site or use dark patterns to trick me into&#xA;paying them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don&#39;t feel safe, I have&#xA;the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I have &#34;the choice&#34; to do&#xA;a food safety inspection of every restaurant I visit, but I do not want to and&#xA;I wouldn&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking for, so I trust my local health department. This allows me to visit any restaurant stress-free, without food safety taking up space in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go through&#xA;the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means Apple takes a cut&#xA;of everything. As a user, this means one central place where I can manage&#xA;(read: cancel) subscriptions&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;no digging through menus or talking to customer&#xA;service agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-subscriptions-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of iOS App Store showing multiple active subscriptions&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-subscription-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;iOS App Store showing options to change or cancel a subscription&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The App Store&#39;s subscriptions management menus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party auth&#xA;providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means building&#xA;another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this means I get a native,&#xA;one-tap, FaceID sign-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figure style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;video autoplay loop muted style=&#34;max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-signin-dark.mov&#34; type=&#34;video/quicktime&#34; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-signin-dark.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/video&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see the more&#xA;I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing &#34;public goods&#34;,&#xA;whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad clickthrough&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;data, eyeballs,&#xA;and engagement. Of course, this has its problems. Apple is a private company,&#xA;not elected officials, so is only as beholden to its end users as it wants to&#xA;be. For now, the incentives seem aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;offline&#34;&gt;Offline-first vs. Online-first Design&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in attitude&#xA;Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user identity. To&#xA;Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is just a window into that&#xA;account. The device may have some caching and synchronization to remain useful&#xA;offline, but ultimately Google&#39;s servers are the source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data between&#xA;multiple devices, but it&#39;s just that&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;synchronization. Apps usually wait until&#xA;the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you can even still perform a&#xA;first-class OS-level sync of all your data to another device with a cable&#xA;instead of iCloud. You can also opt to keep everything local.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways these differences are expressed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Google wants a blurry line between web and native experiences; its official&#xA;apps are going the way of PWAs and similar tech that can be deployed to web&#xA;and app ~identically. In contrast Apple puts every major UX flow in a native&#xA;app, from email and calendar to bug reporting and account management. Even&#xA;uploading apps to the App Store for publishing&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;a fundamentally online&#xA;experience&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;is a native macOS app.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Google Docs documents are rows in a database. Apple Pages documents are files&#xA;on a filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a phone&#xA;number or email), not an Apple account&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;even if the bubble is blue. You may&#xA;even be unknowingly using a combination of phone and email for one contact,&#xA;because iMessage silently interleaves them if they&#39;re owned by the same Apple&#xA;account. If that person later removes one from their Apple account, your&#xA;iMessage thread with them retroactively splits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call from your&#xA;computer, you&#39;re going through Google&#39;s servers. In the Apple ecosystem,&#xA;when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad, you&#39;re connecting&#xA;locally to your iPhone to route the call.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic&#xA;always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly&#xA;experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a machine&#xA;are centralized in iCloud settings where they&#39;re often off by default. I still&#xA;can&#39;t get one of my Safaris to synchronize its bookmarks with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;committment&#34;&gt;Commitment vs. Experimentation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google is infamous for killing products. They release early, often, and in&#xA;isolation; see Hangouts and Allo, Meet and Duo, or Reminders and Tasks.&#xA;Innovation comes first and stablizing the product offering comes second, when&#xA;the product is proven (or not proven) to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple instead takes the &#34;measure twice, cut once&#34; approach; products are&#xA;rarely released and rarely killed. The iPod was around for 21 years,&#xA;co-existing with the iPhone for 12 of them. Apple Maps was a notoriously&#xA;failed app at launch in 2012 and still suffers from that reputational injury,&#xA;however &lt;em&gt;it&#39;s still around anyway&lt;/em&gt; and has improved drastically (although&#xA;whether enough is &lt;a href=&#34;#maps&#34;&gt;still in question&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google&#39;s reputation for killing products causes a negative feedback loop. When&#xA;Google releases a product that relies on market buy-in&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;say, a watch OS (needs&#xA;app developer buy-in) or a chat app (needs consumer buy-in)&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it&#39;s an uphill&#xA;battle to get the market on board, because it knows Google may turn around and&#xA;kill the product anyway. This lack of buy-in seals the product&#39;s fate, and it&#xA;goes to the graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Apple&#39;s reputation for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; killing products causes the market to&#xA;embrace it with open arms, kicking off a positive feedback loop that ensures its&#xA;success. iPad needed developers to design for a different form factor to be&#xA;successful, and they did. Apple Watch needed developers to design watch flows&#xA;for their app to be successful, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are more factors at play than reputation, like developer experience and&#xA;user experience, but the point stands&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;a reputation for killing products&#xA;contributes to more product deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;specifics&#34;&gt;Specific Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are my notes on moving between the ecosystems at specific touchpoints. To&#xA;see an overview, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;#toc&#34;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;key&#34;&gt;Key&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;✔ Switch successful; happily using Apple product&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ⅹ Switch unsuccessful; moved back to Google or to another product&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;⚠ Nuanced&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;macos&#34;&gt;✔ ArchLinux → macOS&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a decade,&#xA;so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass migration. I grew up&#xA;gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for development due to a love of the&#xA;POSIX command line and the simplicity of the system. I found macOS to scratch&#xA;the same itches without the days spent customizing and debugging things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use to&#xA;apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and, including taps, a&#xA;breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it) the AUR. It also bundles its&#xA;own service management, e.g.&#xA;&lt;code&gt;brew services start postgresql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between Windows&#xA;security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It&#39;s good enough that it&#xA;stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I&#39;ll have to type my password&#xA;to unlock 1Password here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The app ethos on macOS is that all apps are self-contained &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files, and&#xA;uninstalling an app is defined as &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;ing that file. It&#39;s spoiled me to&#xA;hesitation when I encounter the rare app that needs an installer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half the apps I use are available on the macOS App Store. For apps it&#xA;manages, it handles updates, payments, and even&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting_app_store_reviews&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;prompts for&#xA;review&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;I generally look there first when searching for an app, then Homebrew (if I know&#xA;what I&#39;m looking for), then Google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ipad&#34;&gt;✔ Nexus 7 → iPad&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it should&#xA;give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user to be&#xA;using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the&#xA;tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually worse than using the&#xA;same app on my phone. I expected a more polished but overall similar&#xA;experience from iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some light&#xA;computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the form factor; apps&#xA;use it to display more and differently laid out information. Generally, the&#xA;extra horizontal space is used to persistently display a nav menu or the&#xA;previous screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-iphone-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPhone.&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-ipad-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPad, using extra space for navigation.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wikipedia on iPhone vs. iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw this as a&#xA;marketing move, but I&#39;ve learned they really did push the needle more in the&#xA;direction of general-purpose computing. The three features that did it for me&#xA;are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multiple windows for one app&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Files app&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better multitasking&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but being able&#xA;to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply feels great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple also takes a strong stance on whether a feature will be available on both platforms.&#xA;For example, iPad does not allow swipe-typing;&#xA;iPad can show multiple apps on the screen at a time, but iPhone cannot; and&#xA;iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay.&#xA;I felt confused about these inconsistencies at first, but I see Apple’s angle&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;none of them quite make sense on the other form factor.&#xA;Apple would rather withhold the feature than allow using it to be confusing or unintuitive.&#xA;Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad because&#xA;Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second monitor, and&#xA;the ability to use a Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control it. macOS’s&#xA;Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input device for signing documents&#xA;and marking up images. This is something I did before by manually transferring&#xA;files, but now it’s two clicks with instant sync.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;iphone&#34;&gt;✔ Pixel → iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, iOS shines when you use native apps.&#xA;Apple apps especially, but also any (rare) third party app&#xA;that takes the care to support all the small UX goodies.&#xA;The more native apps, the better the UX.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, multi-touch can be used to drag-and-drop items between apps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figure style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;video autoplay loop muted style=&#34;max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-drag-photos-dark.mov&#34; type=&#34;video/quicktime&#34; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-drag-photos-dark.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/video&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figure style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;video autoplay loop muted style=&#34;max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-drag-text-dark.mov&#34; type=&#34;video/quicktime&#34; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-drag-text-dark.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/video&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using multi-touch to drag and drop items between apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FaceID is about on par with fingerprint unlock on Pixel.&#xA;They each encounter their own troubles,&#xA;but both are great overall and I&#39;m no more or less happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;fi&#34;&gt;Google Fi&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier. We&#xA;decided to stay with it because they&#39;d recently started to officially support&#xA;iPhone. However, after about a year we found out that Google Fi had been&#xA;intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages from iPhones, leading one friend&#xA;(I hope only one) and I to think we were ghosting each other. Once I learned&#xA;this, Summer and I immediately switched off Google Fi to T-Mobile, which had a&#xA;close ethical alignment around contracts and data usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I can&#39;t&#xA;see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and long-term bug that&#xA;was never even communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;notifications&#34;&gt;Notifications&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference&#xA;makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call them a sidegrade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on&#xA;your phone then read that email on any platform, the notification goes away.&#xA;Otherwise, the notification will be there even days later. In this way,&#xA;Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the notification is&#xA;(usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the phone is unlocked the&#xA;notification moves to a secondary location “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen.&#xA;I do inbox zero, so this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications&#xA;by committing the cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers in the&#xA;corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android notifications&#xA;are, so can be used as a todo list. They&#39;re a decent enough substitute that&#xA;although I still prefer Android’s notifications, the difference is a couple of&#xA;orders of magnitude less impactful than I scoped it out as.&#xA;iOS doesn&#39;t have Android&#39;s support for natively granular notification muting,&#xA;so this separation is sometimes useful to not completely black hole a misbehaving app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;imessage&#34;&gt;iMessage&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about&#xA;“solving” mobile chat&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it’s been solved for them for years. iMessage is the&#xA;gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the guilty urge to nudge friends&#xA;towards iPhone so I can use it with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned re: Apple&#39;s device-first philosophy,&#xA;to users iMessage threads appear to be between contacts,&#xA;but behind the scenes they&#39;re between contact &lt;em&gt;methods&lt;/em&gt; like phone numbers or email addresses.&#xA;I presume this is so people don&#39;t need an Apple account to use iMessage,&#xA;but it has quite a few papercuts.&#xA;I recently changed my email address,&#xA;but because of this behavior I need to keep my old email in my Apple account indefinitely&#xA;so my friends’ threads with me (read: with my old email) don’t retroactively split.&#xA;I&#39;ve also encountered unsolvable problems spinning up group chats with &lt;a href=&#34;https://jm.dev&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;since he switched to a Japanese phone number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these rare issues I&#39;m very happy with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iMessage include rich embedded media from Apple products like Photos, Music, and Maps,&#xA;and automatically entering SMS or email 2FA codes on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-2fa-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of a 2FA prompt suggesting an auto-fill from iMessage.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signing into a website on macOS using the SMS 2FA code from iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;watch&#34;&gt;✔ Moto 360 → Apple Watch&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My relationship with the Moto 360 was on and off. To me it served two&#xA;functions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let me check the time without taking out my phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let me check a notification without taking out my phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These were helpful functions, but the work of managing an extra battery to&#xA;charge and an extra device to put on and take off made me fluctuate every six&#xA;months or so between wearing it every day and not wearing it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Watch adds enough bullet points that I&#39;ve had no such fluctuations&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;I&#xA;wear it daily:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unlock macOS/iOS when nearby, in lieu of entering a password/passcode&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vibrate in patterns for Apple Maps navigation directions (e.g. one pattern&#xA;for upcoming left, another for upcoming right)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pay using Apple Pay by tapping&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shazam a song without taking out your phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Show popped reminders or upcoming calendar events on the watch face&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Control Keynote presentations (e.g. tap for next slide)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;View your phone&#39;s camera viewfinder live and tap to snap (e.g. for group&#xA;photos)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Control media playback&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#34;Walkie-talkie&#34; with a close friend&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above, the third-party app ecosystem plays ball with Apple&#xA;Watch a lot more than the Android app ecosystem does with Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;appletv&#34;&gt;✔ Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have HomePods and Summer forbids me to get any (reasonably) after&#xA;filling our home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey&#xA;Google, play &lt;code&gt;$SHOW&lt;/code&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to casting from your phone Apple TV and Chromecast are both good,&#xA;but Chromecast shines brighter. Casting is a first-class citizen on Chromecast&#xA;because it&#39;s all you have. I&#39;ve seen more apps expose a Chromecast icon than an&#xA;AirPlay icon, and casting to an Apple TV that&#39;s asleep sometimes just turns it&#xA;on without playing anything. We now just use the remote as our default control&#xA;mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;remote&#34;&gt;The Remote&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that it&#39;s&#xA;pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use;&#xA;I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it has a good build quality. It&#39;s not IR,&#xA;so you don&#39;t have to point it at anything. Because the Apple TV can forward&#xA;incoming buttonpresses to the attached television, it&#39;s a strict upgrade even for television controls&#xA;like volume adjustment. But it’s a remote, and can&#xA;be lost or have sticky liquids spiked into it like any other. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that keeps it on the side of the coffee table. I&#xA;miss the remote-free life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is selected on&#xA;the Apple TV, a notification shows on your iOS devices allowing you to use them&#xA;as keyboards. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for&#xA;invoking 1Password to fill logins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;home&#34;&gt;✔ Google Home → Apple Home&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent building up&#xA;our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a Raspberry Pi made it all&#xA;work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV showing our Nest doorbell camera&#xA;picture-in-picture when the doorbell rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a&#xA;Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home Hub.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list that&#xA;feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT gateway,&#xA;having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center pull-down menus, and&#xA;hooking up more devices through automation with Shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;airpods&#34;&gt;✔ Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true.&#xA;Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my&#xA;ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs, even for flights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; is literally too good;&#xA;I had to turn it off. Again and again I became very nervous that I was blasting&#xA;sound from my speakers, so I would have to briefly remove one earbud to ensure&#xA;I wasn&#39;t. The anxiety of this was so distracting as to be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between devices based&#xA;on attention, and a Siri integration slightly worse than Pixel Buds&#39;s Google&#xA;Assistant integration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mail&#34;&gt;⚠ Gmail → iCloud Mail&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I control&#xA;anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;migrating&#34;&gt;Migrating Emails&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the experience&#xA;was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired result. After&#xA;starting from scratch several times and hitting new issues every time, I’ve&#xA;chosen to live the life of searching in two places when I need something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;migratingaddresses&#34;&gt;Migrating Email Addresses&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To migrate email addresses I made a very tough decision that I&#39;m still&#xA;frustrated years later that I had to make, which was to change Google accounts.&#xA;This is because I want my Google account&#39;s primary email address to be the one I give to people,&#xA;as small usability quirks abound when it isn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I give you my email address, ben@twos.dev.&#xA;You invite that email address to a meeting on Google Calendar with an attached Meet meeting.&#xA;When I accept, it accepts from my Google account, not from the invited email address, so you see an unknown person added to the meeting, while I appear to have not responded.&#xA;When it&#39;s time for the meeting, I attempt to join the Meet but get thrown into a waiting room because my Google account wasn&#39;t invited by you. Even worse, if you don&#39;t show up but the meeting should still happen (let&#39;s say a team meeting), I have no way to join.&#xA;Google Groups experiences similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried to use a twos.dev Google Workspace account as my primary Google account first but many Google features don&#39;t support Workspace accounts,&#xA;like Google One,&#xA;family sharing,&#xA;some security features,&#xA;and (for better and worse) some types of data harvesting and therefore ad/search targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m left to creating a new personal Google account with &lt;code&gt;ben@twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; as its primary email address.&#xA;Signing up to Google without an &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address is a somewhat hidden option,&#xA;but it exists.&#xA;You just can&#39;t ever fall into the &#34;upgrade&#34; funnel that assigns you an &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address, because that can never be undone.&#xA;And of course, this means you can never use Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of this would be so frustrating if there weren&#39;t so many things tied to my&#xA;Google account, like Maps reviews, decades of chat history, and purchased content.&#xA;I desperately wanted to keep my account,&#xA;but there&#39;s just no way around all the little hiccups.&#xA;For a brain like mine that can&#39;t handle those, things are as &#34;walled garden&#34; as you&#39;d expect from an Apple product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;daily&#34;&gt;Daily Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve installed&#xA;Thunderbird to get by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and has a&#xA;solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail&#39;s junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk folder,&#xA;even after months of correcting it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud Drive links&#xA;instead (Google has this same behavior with Drive), but I&#39;ve had recipients experience trouble downloading them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Gmail&#39;s search is an order of magnitude better than Mail&#39;s.&#xA;It&#39;s what I miss most.&#xA;In Mail, what I&#39;m searching for is often buried beneath piles of things I&#39;m not.&#xA;Clicking on results sometimes lands me in the right thread but on the wrong email.&#xA;On macOS searches only happen in the mailbox being viewed (e.g. Inbox)&#xA;and it takes an extra click to search everything,&#xA;which is easy to forget.&#xA;(iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by default.)&#xA;And when you are done searching and click Inbox to &#34;return home&#34;&#xA;the search field doesn&#39;t clear,&#xA;leading you to a seemingly empty Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail is below average at threading emails:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once in a while, it omits an email from a thread that it shouldn’t have.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When replying to a thread, the sent email doesn&#39;t appear immediately in the local&#xA;view, which makes it seem like something has gone wrong with the sending.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When marking a thread as &#34;Notify&#34; (a nice feature which forces updates to the thread&#xA;to send a push notification even when they&#39;re off), emails sent into the thread by you&#xA;trigger the push. Even emails from the same platform and app that is in charge of&#xA;notifying.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail has a high failure rate for autocollapsing quotes in email replies,&#xA;causing some frustratingly long nested quotes in long threads.&#xA;Gmail was always good at collapsing them automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail is bad at converting text to rich text. For example, it will not automatically&#xA;convert markdown-esque lists (e.g. &lt;code&gt;1. Some text&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;- Some text&lt;/code&gt;) to rich text lists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service has a&#xA;separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have disparate&#xA;feature sets and don&#39;t synchronize. iOS Mail does not support filters. I’ve&#xA;opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because the iCloud filters can only&#xA;check one condition per filter, and I just have my iMac stay awake 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to archive.&#xA;Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for any app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-rebind-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of macOS&#39;s Settings.app rebinding a key for Mail.app.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any macOS app&#39;s menu actions (e.g. File → Save) can be [re]bound natively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want a Mail-like experience with Gmail as a backend, instead of using&#xA;SMTP I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://mimestream.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mimestream&lt;/a&gt;; it is written by a former&#xA;Apple Mail engineer to have a similar UX but using proper Gmail APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in Spotlight&#xA;and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;calendar&#34;&gt;⚠ Google Calendar → Apple Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I switched to Apple Calendar as both an app and a calendar provider. I&#39;d&#xA;forgotten how limited and finicky calendar protocols are at their core. Many&#xA;things just stop working when you leave Google Calendar. Folks send me&#xA;invitations that don&#39;t show, my RSVPs don&#39;t make it back to them, and I&#xA;sometimes don&#39;t receive updates to events. Even unfurling invited mailing lists&#xA;into individuals (who can then RSVP individuallly) is specific to Google&#xA;Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I switched my provider back to Google Calendar about 18 months in while&#xA;continuing to use the Apple Calendar app. It&#39;s a much better experience while&#xA;sacrificing virtually nothing in ecosystem benefits. I also get to avoid the&#xA;crappy Apple Calendar web UI those few times I need my calendar on Windows, and&#xA;I get the more powerful sharing / RSVP tools of Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the Apple Calendar iOS and macOS apps, I don&#39;t recommend using the Week&#xA;view. Like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to&#xA;represent the current time of day; but this bar extends 100% of the width of the&#xA;week, and does not do a good job showing you which day today is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-calendar-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of Calendar.app on macOS showing a week with a red line across it.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it is?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing panic&#xA;about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar only shows&#xA;when viewing today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say they&#xA;appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a calendar invitation&#xA;there are two attachments, &lt;code&gt;invite.ics&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mime-attachment.ics&lt;/code&gt;. Each will pop&#xA;up a Calendar float to add the event. I don&#39;t know the difference; since&#xA;switching to Google Calendar as a backend I&#39;ve learned to RSVP using the&#xA;embedded buttons which (outside of Gmail) open a web browser to the Google&#xA;Calendar UI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figure style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;video autoplay loop muted style=&#34;max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-mail-dark.mov&#34; type=&#34;video/quicktime&#34; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-mail-dark.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/video&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opening a Google Calendar invitation from within the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed to&#xA;have a refresh in a decade. Apple Calendar can automatically generate “travel&#xA;to” and “travel from” events based on the travel time between locations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps, Siri suggestions&#xA;for navigation destinations and video calls, and the ability to longpress dates and times in iMessage to create events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;maps&#34;&gt;⚠ Google Maps → Apple Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly so. But&#xA;that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved. Unfortunately it’s&#xA;only gotten good, not great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are UX benefits over Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past&#xA;this light, then at the next one, turn &lt;code&gt;$DIRECTION&lt;/code&gt;”, but about 5% of my trips&#xA;to new places end me at the right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been&#xA;routed to the delivery entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an airport,&#xA;and the wrong parking lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) for a store in a large&#xA;shopping center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos, menus,&#xA;ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here; their purchase&#xA;of Yelp means they inherit photos &amp;amp; reviews, but even that can&#39;t beat the&#xA;sheer volume Google Maps. I&#39;ve only seen one or two restaurants with ordering&#xA;functionality enabled. Many business hours are out of date&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;I update them when I&#xA;notice, but I&#39;m just one person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and Calendar,&#xA;Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other sources, and Apple&#xA;Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming turns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;byemaps&#34;&gt;Departure&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to continue to give Apple Maps chances because I know more data helps, but for tight&#xA;schedules I wouldn&#39;t chance it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;findmy&#34;&gt;✔ Location Sharing → Find My&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends and&#xA;family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple offering (a&#xA;separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one would be happy with&#xA;the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must launch&#xA;with intention, but it&#39;s a wash for me. I&#39;ve had several serendipitous encounters&#xA;enabled by seeing a friend is close by in Google Maps accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AirTags and device tracking are the big killer features here, which work&#xA;as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one in my bag just to&#xA;have peace of mind. The app sends a notification when I leave &lt;code&gt;$DEVICE&lt;/code&gt; at&#xA;&lt;code&gt;$LOCATION&lt;/code&gt;, with easy controls to disable future notifications for any such&#xA;combination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;✔ Google Photos → Apple Photos&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly, these two products are equivalent. Apple Photos has more powerful&#xA;editing tools but Google Photos has more powerful search. Both have similar&#xA;tooling around memories, viewing photos on maps or by year, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classically, Google has a better web experience and Apple has a better native&#xA;experience, meaning sharing photos with others is better in Apple Photos if and&#xA;only if you&#39;re sharing with other Apple users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;ve been getting more into photography I&#39;ve come to like how smooth the&#xA;import experience is in macOS&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;insert SD card, Photos.app automatically opens up&#xA;to the Import window, I tick &#34;Automatically delete photos after import&#34; and tell&#xA;it go, and it&#39;s done. I can take the SD card out and the photos will upload in&#xA;the background. The Google equivalent isn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; but it takes more&#xA;babysitting,&#xA;either messing with the filesystem or leaving the SD card in for the entire duration of the upload&#xA;(and in my case, forgetting to retrieve it later).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The migration from Google Photos to Apple Photos was simple, but long. Google&#xA;Takeout produced hundreds of gigabytes of exports, which I downloaded onto a Mac&#xA;and then imported with Photos.app. Due to Apple&#39;s offline-first approach&#xA;synchronization&#xA;tried to take place while the laptop was closed and charging. This was jarring&#xA;at first when trying to babysit the process, as by design it stops performing&#xA;well when you start using the machine. When I learned to let go, it showed its&#xA;colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects include rich support for embeds &amp;amp; commenting in iMessage, and photos&#xA;appearing in upload prompts on all platforms (e.g. when uploading an avatar to&#xA;some random internet account) with full face search embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;safari&#34;&gt;⚠ Chrome → Safari&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from&#xA;bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the Chrome&#xA;chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone applications even&#xA;when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go backward or forward slides&#xA;the page on/off screen allowing you to peek without navigating, but it&#xA;backfires and feels artificial for low-travel anchor links and some&#xA;single-page app transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the&#xA;navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can&#39;t&#xA;identify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it works it&#39;s beautiful and useful, but when it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s jarring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figure style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;video autoplay loop muted style=&#34;max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-back-dark.mov&#34; type=&#34;video/quicktime&#34; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-back-dark.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/video&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating through history in Safari with swipe gestures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced some local-only&#xA;webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others.&#xA;Meet also supports more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one tab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff (move a browsing session between&#xA;devices smoothly) and the downright bonkers power efficiency of Safari on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;keychain&#34;&gt;✔ iCloud Keychain&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I initially moved to Safari,&#xA;iCloud Keychain was not powerful enough to replace my use of 1Password.&#xA;It did not support multiple domain names per website,&#xA;arbitrary text notes,&#xA;or custom names for entries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of 2023 September, these problems seem solved.&#xA;There are stil some shortfalls,&#xA;but &lt;a href=&#34;https://simonbs.dev/posts/moving-from-1password-to-icloud-keychain/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simon Støvring&#39;s post&lt;/a&gt; helped shore them up;&#xA;I&#39;ve used his locked-notes strategy for non-password things I previously kept in 1Password,&#xA;and all is well so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there are still some small downsides:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Passwords are accessed from within the Preferences pane of Safari, macOS, or iOS.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The difficulty of accessing them can be completely solved using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4cd82a3e2a5c4fc78b8f1a488c5b76e7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this Shortcut&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be awkward to refresh authentication with e.g. an Exchange account, as you cannot have two System Settings windows open at once.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Domain names for passwords are not directly editable, possibly for security reasons. To assign one password to multiple domains, you have to use the same credentials for another website and depend on it to invisibly merge them behind the scenes, which it often does, but in a way that&#39;s hard to diagnose if it doesn&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s no &#34;Archive&#34; feature, so I have to decide if passwords I &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; won&#39;t need again should be front-and-center or deleted forever.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Windows support for Chrome exists via an extension that talks to the local iCloud background application, but requires typing a verification code every reboot and sometimes doesn&#39;t autofill quickly or at all.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m hoping these get fixed, but for now I&#39;m happy enough working around them for the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include&#xA;faster and more fluid autofill support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS;&#xA;automatic iCloud synchronization,&#xA;and easily setup of password groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;numbers&#34;&gt;✔ Google Sheets → Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To a casual user like me,&#xA;Sheets and Numbers are ~identical.&#xA;Numbers has a slightly nicer UX for editing formulae and tries to humanize references,&#xA;e.g. “Ben age” for a cell in a row with header “Ben” and a column with header “Age”, instead of A:123.&#xA;This is nice until headers get long and multiworded, and you use them in long formulae.&#xA;Overall it’s a wash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google Sheets has a network effect going for it,&#xA;so I still use it whenever I need to share a sheet with someone not on an Apple platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Numbers include Spotlight integration for quickly opening a sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;✔ Keep → Apple Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;get out of my way and let me&#xA;write. Let me deal with organization later. Keep gives me that. Its layout is hard to&#xA;browse and hasn&#39;t aged well visually, but it makes up for it with great search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on&#xA;shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform notes with rich text&#xA;support like headers, tables, monospaced text, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So where Keep is best used as a searchable cloud or swarm of notes, Notes is best used as&#xA;a curated and categorized filing cabinet. One note in Notes might be several dozen in&#xA;Keep, so the effort spent on curation is not so large, and neither is the impact of&#xA;only-okay search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After moving to Notes.app I jumped around to Org-mode, Bear, and Obsidian,&#xA;but ultimately landed up back in Notes.&#xA;I only wish there were a non-hacky way to export from it,&#xA;but I landed back in Notes despite that absence, not because of it.&#xA;(I started jumping around specifically because of it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts,&#xA;one-click &#34;upgrade&#34; to a Pages document,&#xA;a collaboration UX that spans Messages, Mail, AirDrop, and Reminders,&#xA;cross-app drag-and-drop,&#xA;and &#34;quick notes&#34; which use OS-wide gestures to capture ideas into a staging area quickly à la &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Org Capture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;reminders&#34;&gt;✔ Tasks → Reminders&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS.&#xA;It is simple and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders can be scheduled to “pop” (send a push notification and become &#34;due&#34;) at:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A due date&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A due date and time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When arriving at a location&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When leaving a location&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When getting in a car&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When leaving a car&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When messaging &lt;code&gt;$PERSON&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders can belong to lists (e.g. work vs. personal).&#xA;Lists can have sections (e.g. pack bedroom items vs. pack kitchen items).&#xA;Lists can be shared,&#xA;and reminders within shared lists can be assigned to people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders can have priorities, notes, URLs, tags, and subtasks.&#xA;Reminders can have images attached to them.&#xA;Reminders can repeat on schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders are synchronized between devices, even Macs,&#xA;so popped reminders show up where you are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, Summer and I share a family reminders list.&#xA;On that list is a single reminder that repeats every trash day,&#xA;and pops when I arrive home.&#xA;It’s assigned to me, so it only pops for me.&#xA;But if Summer takes out the trash before I get home, the reminder doesn&#39;t pop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share sheet in&#xA;native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in the URL field)&#xA;and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder (if any) on my Apple&#xA;Watch homescreen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;siri&#34;&gt;ⅹ Google Assistant → Siri&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can&#39;t answer questions&#xA;like &#34;What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?&#34; or &#34;Who played Alan in&#xA;Tron Legacy?&#34;. Its best uses are for deep integrations like setting reminders or alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Siri include interaction with native apps:&#xA;setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home devices, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;shortcuts&#34;&gt;✔ Google Assistant Routines → Shortcuts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most&#xA;power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had&#xA;around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it to shell&#xA;scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/apple-shortcuts-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a shortcut on iOS.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I use Shortcuts.app to block times on my work calendar based on personal events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one example, when I wrote in the iA Writer mobile app I would use Shortcuts to&#xA;automatically commit and push my writing to twos.dev daily. Because iA&#xA;Writer stores files in iCloud, and another iOS app called Working Copy can&#xA;interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Pull from &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; remote&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(iOS) Get contents of folder &lt;code&gt;iCloud/iA Writer/Published&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Write contents of folder to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twos.dev/winter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./src/warm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Stage &lt;code&gt;./src/warm&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Commit &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; with message “Automatic commit by iA Writer&#xA;sync job”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Push &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; to remote&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could&#xA;do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say that my phone is&#xA;a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;drive&#34;&gt;⚠ Google Drive → iCloud Drive&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception. Use it&#xA;if you&#39;re in the Apple ecosystem, and don&#39;t if you&#39;re not. The biggest downside&#xA;I&#39;ve witnessed is that iCloud Drive does not have an API. This is not a problem&#xA;when running software on a persistent macOS or Windows machine, but for Linux or&#xA;for ephemeral machines (e.g. CI) the only option is an unofficial&#xA;reverse-engineered solution. This may be the reason I ultimately switch to&#xA;something else. I have been trying out Syncthing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow between&#xA;your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for first-party and&#xA;some third-party apps to use it as a default data store anyway (e.g. Pages&#xA;saves documents there, Numbers saves spreadsheets there).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS also pulls a trick where it invisibly queues up actions on iCloud Drive&#xA;files that haven&#39;t yet fully synced to your machine yet. For example, if you are&#xA;on your iPhone and place an image in iCloud Drive, then open a Mac,&#xA;the image will show up ~immediately in macOS Finder, before it has finished&#xA;syncing. If you try to open the file in macOS before it finishes, the open&#xA;action will queue until the sync finishes, then execute. This behavior is nice&#xA;compared to the industry standard of trying to open a broken file, but when you&#xA;first encounter it with a large file like a video it&#39;s easy to perceive it as&#xA;OS-level slowness or stalling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;ⅹ YouTube Music → Apple Music&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:&#xA;services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified a lot&#xA;of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator workflow that&#xA;would move the cursor to my existing library, select and copy a title, then&#xA;move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and add the top result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with the&#xA;iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app. Navigation is&#xA;slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact that it takes too many&#xA;transitions to get where you’re going. For details on its UX failings, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jake&#xA;from Cinnamon&#39;s&#xA;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration, Spotlight integration, and better&#xA;Siri support for playing things handsfree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;byemusic&#34;&gt;Departure&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I miss Google Play Music, which solved all my problems. I&#39;ve softly switched to Spotify&#xA;which seems overall better, almost strictly so if it weren&#39;t for ecosystem effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;pay&#34;&gt;✔ Google Pay → Apple Pay&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me embarrassed to use&#xA;it. It was hard to find &#34;the spot&#34; on credit card machines to tap. Apple Pay&#xA;feels more spatially generous; once I start hunting for the spot, it&#39;s already&#xA;been found. It could be because the iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of&#xA;the device while Pixels have them in the middle, or maybe the world has just&#xA;gotten better at this since then. I&#39;m now using Apple Pay every chance I get.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the&#xA;purchases I make in Seattle, about 95% of shops and restaurants with counter pay&#xA;support Apple Pay, and about 20% of table-service restaurants&#xA;do. For online orders, roughly half of the non-Amazon orders I place support&#xA;it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first credit card&#xA;experience that feels like it was made this century. The app is beautiful,&#xA;snappy, and simple. The rewards (2% cashback on everything via Apple Pay, 1% on everything else) are good but beatable; several banks now have universal 2% cashback cards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figure style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;video autoplay loop muted style=&#34;max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-card-dark.mov&#34; type=&#34;video/quicktime&#34; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;/img/apple-card-dark.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/video&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drilling into Apple Card transactions using Wallet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts&#34;&gt;✔ Google Podcasts → Apple Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google Podcasts and Apple Podcasts are very comparable. Google Podcasts has a&#xA;bit plainer UI, but they&#39;re both good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest upside to Apple Podcasts is the better sorting and filtering of&#xA;episodes on a podcast-specific basis. For example, I like Planet Money enough&#xA;that I want to listen to every episode, so I have them play from oldest to&#xA;newest; most other podcasts I don&#39;t care so much and have no hope of working&#xA;through their backlogs, so I go newest to oldest. These all interleave&#xA;correctly when I hit the podcast-agnostic &#34;Play&#34; button on the homescreen, so&#xA;that the correct episodes of each podcast are played.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest downside to Apple Podcasts has been stability. Roughly 1-5% of&#xA;the time I go to play a podcast, the player gets stuck loading it forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Podcasts include tight Siri support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a living document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the sum of&#xA;its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned is that it’s&#xA;the long tail of tiny ecosystem benefits that makes up most of that excess. Not the&#xA;two or three things per product I’ve mentioned above, but the dozens that&#xA;happen without me noticing that add up to make a more enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are functional&#xA;benefits to working in a clean space&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it’s easier to find things, spilling a&#xA;liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less dust&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;but the bulk of the&#xA;benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways the space feels better and motivates&#xA;more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would not count&#xA;it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell and I&#39;ll continue&#xA;to document my journey here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

</body></html><h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>My life is in Google more than anyone I know. The usual suspects sure<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Gmail,
Photos, Chrome, etc.<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>but also the ones people stay away from<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Tasks, Keep,
YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We
have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook,
the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the
“Google graveyard”. And for a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture
with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it's no surprise I’ve
been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.</p>

<p>But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is
how I understand why<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>or whether<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I prefer what I chose. For Android, that
means trialing an iPhone. <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&amp;t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw" target="_blank">I did
this</a>
five years ago for a few months (thanks <a href="https://bensw.com" target="_blank">bensw</a>), but
afterwards I thought "It's actually not that different, it's just that the
Google apps don't feel native, so I’ll stick with Android".</p>

<p>Since then, I've realized it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition
without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the same reason Google apps
don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn't shine if you only use Google apps.</p>

<p>So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an honest,
holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me out, but better to
trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know
one. These are my notes on hopping the fence.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Broad Themes</h2>

<p>Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I'll summarize
the themes I've witnessed during them.</p>

<h3 id="safety">Safety vs. Freedom</h3>

<p>In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I'd long ago published its
Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding denial after denial.
I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user, and I could see with fresh
eyes the effects of the strictness.</p>

<p>Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating system. They
don't feel like they were written by others, and that makes me feel safe. My
data feels like part of my device, not part of Google. And I trust my device
to manage my payment, location, etc. data, because it is mine. I own it.</p>

<p>That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight for it.
But it's a good feeling. And it only comes with control<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>control by a
representative I trust, over parties I don't. I don't know app developers,
especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through them I can trust app
developers, but only because Apple so heavily controls what they can publish.
They can't send me to their sketchy site or use dark patterns to trick me into
paying them.</p>

<p>Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don't feel safe, I have
the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I have "the choice" to do
a food safety inspection of every restaurant I visit, but I do not want to and
I wouldn't know what I'm looking for, so I trust my local health department. This allows me to visit any restaurant stress-free, without food safety taking up space in my brain.</p>

<p>For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go through
the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means Apple takes a cut
of everything. As a user, this means one central place where I can manage
(read: cancel) subscriptions<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>no digging through menus or talking to customer
service agents.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-subscriptions-dark.png" alt="Screenshot of iOS App Store showing multiple active subscriptions"/>
<img src="/img/apple-subscription-dark.png" alt="iOS App Store showing options to change or cancel a subscription"/></p>

<p><em>The App Store's subscriptions management menus.</em></p>

<p>Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party auth
providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means building
another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this means I get a native,
one-tap, FaceID sign-in.</p>
<p>
  <figure style="text-align: center">
    <video autoplay loop muted style="max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%">
      <source src="/img/apple-signin-dark.mov" type="video/quicktime" />
      <source src="/img/apple-signin-dark.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
  </figure>
</p>
<p>These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see the more
I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing "public goods",
whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad clickthrough<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>data, eyeballs,
and engagement. Of course, this has its problems. Apple is a private company,
not elected officials, so is only as beholden to its end users as it wants to
be. For now, the incentives seem aligned.</p>

<h3 id="offline">Offline-first vs. Online-first Design</h3>

<p>Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in attitude
Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user identity. To
Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is just a window into that
account. The device may have some caching and synchronization to remain useful
offline, but ultimately Google's servers are the source of truth.</p>

<p>To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data between
multiple devices, but it's just that<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>synchronization. Apps usually wait until
the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you can even still perform a
first-class OS-level sync of all your data to another device with a cable
instead of iCloud. You can also opt to keep everything local.</p>

<p>Here are some ways these differences are expressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google wants a blurry line between web and native experiences; its official
apps are going the way of PWAs and similar tech that can be deployed to web
and app ~identically. In contrast Apple puts every major UX flow in a native
app, from email and calendar to bug reporting and account management. Even
uploading apps to the App Store for publishing<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a fundamentally online
experience<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>is a native macOS app.</li>
<li>Google Docs documents are rows in a database. Apple Pages documents are files
on a filesystem.</li>
<li>When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a phone
number or email), not an Apple account<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>even if the bubble is blue. You may
even be unknowingly using a combination of phone and email for one contact,
because iMessage silently interleaves them if they're owned by the same Apple
account. If that person later removes one from their Apple account, your
iMessage thread with them retroactively splits.</li>
<li>In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call from your
computer, you're going through Google's servers. In the Apple ecosystem,
when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad, you're connecting
locally to your iPhone to route the call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic
always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly
experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a machine
are centralized in iCloud settings where they're often off by default. I still
can't get one of my Safaris to synchronize its bookmarks with the rest.</p>

<h3 id="committment">Commitment vs. Experimentation</h3>

<p>Google is infamous for killing products. They release early, often, and in
isolation; see Hangouts and Allo, Meet and Duo, or Reminders and Tasks.
Innovation comes first and stablizing the product offering comes second, when
the product is proven (or not proven) to work.</p>

<p>Apple instead takes the "measure twice, cut once" approach; products are
rarely released and rarely killed. The iPod was around for 21 years,
co-existing with the iPhone for 12 of them. Apple Maps was a notoriously
failed app at launch in 2012 and still suffers from that reputational injury,
however <em>it's still around anyway</em> and has improved drastically (although
whether enough is <a href="#maps">still in question</a>).</p>

<p>Google's reputation for killing products causes a negative feedback loop. When
Google releases a product that relies on market buy-in<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>say, a watch OS (needs
app developer buy-in) or a chat app (needs consumer buy-in)<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it's an uphill
battle to get the market on board, because it knows Google may turn around and
kill the product anyway. This lack of buy-in seals the product's fate, and it
goes to the graveyard.</p>

<p>In contrast, Apple's reputation for <em>not</em> killing products causes the market to
embrace it with open arms, kicking off a positive feedback loop that ensures its
success. iPad needed developers to design for a different form factor to be
successful, and they did. Apple Watch needed developers to design watch flows
for their app to be successful, and they did.</p>

<p>There are more factors at play than reputation, like developer experience and
user experience, but the point stands<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a reputation for killing products
contributes to more product deaths.</p>

<h2 id="specifics">Specific Notes</h2>

<p>Below are my notes on moving between the ecosystems at specific touchpoints. To
see an overview, visit the <a href="#toc">table of contents</a>.</p>

<h3 id="key">Key</h3>

<ul>
<li>✔ Switch successful; happily using Apple product</li>
<li>ⅹ Switch unsuccessful; moved back to Google or to another product</li>
<li>⚠ Nuanced</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="macos">✔ ArchLinux → macOS</h3>

<p>I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a decade,
so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass migration. I grew up
gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for development due to a love of the
POSIX command line and the simplicity of the system. I found macOS to scratch
the same itches without the days spent customizing and debugging things.</p>

<p>Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use to
apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and, including taps, a
breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it) the AUR. It also bundles its
own service management, e.g.
<code>brew services start postgresql</code>.</p>

<p>TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between Windows
security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It's good enough that it
stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I'll have to type my password
to unlock 1Password here and there.</p>

<p>The app ethos on macOS is that all apps are self-contained <code>.app</code> files, and
uninstalling an app is defined as <code>rm</code>ing that file. It's spoiled me to
hesitation when I encounter the rare app that needs an installer.</p>

<p>Roughly half the apps I use are available on the macOS App Store. For apps it
manages, it handles updates, payments, and even
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting_app_store_reviews" target="_blank">prompts for
review</a>.
I generally look there first when searching for an app, then Homebrew (if I know
what I'm looking for), then Google.</p>

<h3 id="ipad">✔ Nexus 7 → iPad</h3>

<p>My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it should
give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.</p>

<p>When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user to be
using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the
tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually worse than using the
same app on my phone. I expected a more polished but overall similar
experience from iPad.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some light
computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the form factor; apps
use it to display more and differently laid out information. Generally, the
extra horizontal space is used to persistently display a nav menu or the
previous screen.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-iphone-dark.png" alt="A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPhone."/>
<img src="/img/apple-ipad-dark.png" alt="A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPad, using extra space for navigation."/></p>

<p><em>Wikipedia on iPhone vs. iPad.</em></p>

<p>A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw this as a
marketing move, but I've learned they really did push the needle more in the
direction of general-purpose computing. The three features that did it for me
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple windows for one app</li>
<li>Files app</li>
<li>Better multitasking</li>
</ul>

<p>Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but being able
to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply feels great.</p>

<p>Apple also takes a strong stance on whether a feature will be available on both platforms.
For example, iPad does not allow swipe-typing;
iPad can show multiple apps on the screen at a time, but iPhone cannot; and
iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay.
I felt confused about these inconsistencies at first, but I see Apple’s angle<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>
none of them quite make sense on the other form factor.
Apple would rather withhold the feature than allow using it to be confusing or unintuitive.
Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad because
Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second monitor, and
the ability to use a Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control it. macOS’s
Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input device for signing documents
and marking up images. This is something I did before by manually transferring
files, but now it’s two clicks with instant sync.</p>

<h3 id="iphone">✔ Pixel → iPhone</h3>

<p>As I said earlier, iOS shines when you use native apps.
Apple apps especially, but also any (rare) third party app
that takes the care to support all the small UX goodies.
The more native apps, the better the UX.</p>

<p>For example, multi-touch can be used to drag-and-drop items between apps.</p>
<p>
  <figure style="text-align: center">
    <video autoplay loop muted style="max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%">
      <source src="/img/apple-drag-photos-dark.mov" type="video/quicktime" />
      <source src="/img/apple-drag-photos-dark.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
  </figure>
</p>
<p>
  <figure style="text-align: center">
    <video autoplay loop muted style="max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%">
      <source src="/img/apple-drag-text-dark.mov" type="video/quicktime" />
      <source src="/img/apple-drag-text-dark.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
  </figure>
</p>
<p><em>Using multi-touch to drag and drop items between apps.</em></p>

<p>FaceID is about on par with fingerprint unlock on Pixel.
They each encounter their own troubles,
but both are great overall and I'm no more or less happy.</p>

<h4 id="fi">Google Fi</h4>

<p>When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier. We
decided to stay with it because they'd recently started to officially support
iPhone. However, after about a year we found out that Google Fi had been
intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages from iPhones, leading one friend
(I hope only one) and I to think we were ghosting each other. Once I learned
this, Summer and I immediately switched off Google Fi to T-Mobile, which had a
close ethical alignment around contracts and data usage.</p>

<p>Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I can't
see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and long-term bug that
was never even communicated.</p>

<h4 id="notifications">Notifications</h4>

<p>Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference
makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call them a sidegrade.</p>

<p>Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on
your phone then read that email on any platform, the notification goes away.
Otherwise, the notification will be there even days later. In this way,
Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.</p>

<p>iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the notification is
(usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the phone is unlocked the
notification moves to a secondary location “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen.
I do inbox zero, so this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications
by committing the cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.</p>

<p>However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers in the
corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android notifications
are, so can be used as a todo list. They're a decent enough substitute that
although I still prefer Android’s notifications, the difference is a couple of
orders of magnitude less impactful than I scoped it out as.
iOS doesn't have Android's support for natively granular notification muting,
so this separation is sometimes useful to not completely black hole a misbehaving app.</p>

<h4 id="imessage">iMessage</h4>

<p>I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about
“solving” mobile chat<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it’s been solved for them for years. iMessage is the
gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the guilty urge to nudge friends
towards iPhone so I can use it with them.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned re: Apple's device-first philosophy,
to users iMessage threads appear to be between contacts,
but behind the scenes they're between contact <em>methods</em> like phone numbers or email addresses.
I presume this is so people don't need an Apple account to use iMessage,
but it has quite a few papercuts.
I recently changed my email address,
but because of this behavior I need to keep my old email in my Apple account indefinitely
so my friends’ threads with me (read: with my old email) don’t retroactively split.
I've also encountered unsolvable problems spinning up group chats with <a href="https://jm.dev" target="_blank">Jordan</a>
since he switched to a Japanese phone number.</p>

<p>Beyond these rare issues I'm very happy with iMessage.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iMessage include rich embedded media from Apple products like Photos, Music, and Maps,
and automatically entering SMS or email 2FA codes on any device.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-2fa-dark.png" alt="Screenshot of a 2FA prompt suggesting an auto-fill from iMessage."/></p>

<p><em>Signing into a website on macOS using the SMS 2FA code from iPhone.</em></p>

<h3 id="watch">✔ Moto 360 → Apple Watch</h3>

<p>My relationship with the Moto 360 was on and off. To me it served two
functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let me check the time without taking out my phone</li>
<li>Let me check a notification without taking out my phone</li>
</ul>

<p>These were helpful functions, but the work of managing an extra battery to
charge and an extra device to put on and take off made me fluctuate every six
months or so between wearing it every day and not wearing it at all.</p>

<p>Apple Watch adds enough bullet points that I've had no such fluctuations<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I
wear it daily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlock macOS/iOS when nearby, in lieu of entering a password/passcode</li>
<li>Vibrate in patterns for Apple Maps navigation directions (e.g. one pattern
for upcoming left, another for upcoming right)</li>
<li>Pay using Apple Pay by tapping</li>
<li>Shazam a song without taking out your phone</li>
<li>Show popped reminders or upcoming calendar events on the watch face</li>
<li>Control Keynote presentations (e.g. tap for next slide)</li>
<li>View your phone's camera viewfinder live and tap to snap (e.g. for group
photos)</li>
<li>Control media playback</li>
<li>"Walkie-talkie" with a close friend</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the above, the third-party app ecosystem plays ball with Apple
Watch a lot more than the Android app ecosystem does with Wear OS.</p>

<h3 id="appletv">✔ Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV</h3>

<p>We don’t have HomePods and Summer forbids me to get any (reasonably) after
filling our home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey
Google, play <code>$SHOW</code>”.</p>

<p>When it comes to casting from your phone Apple TV and Chromecast are both good,
but Chromecast shines brighter. Casting is a first-class citizen on Chromecast
because it's all you have. I've seen more apps expose a Chromecast icon than an
AirPlay icon, and casting to an Apple TV that's asleep sometimes just turns it
on without playing anything. We now just use the remote as our default control
mechanism.</p>

<h4 id="remote">The Remote</h4>

<p>Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that it's
pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use;
I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Otherwise it has a good build quality. It's not IR,
so you don't have to point it at anything. Because the Apple TV can forward
incoming buttonpresses to the attached television, it's a strict upgrade even for television controls
like volume adjustment. But it’s a remote, and can
be lost or have sticky liquids spiked into it like any other. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that keeps it on the side of the coffee table. I
miss the remote-free life.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is selected on
the Apple TV, a notification shows on your iOS devices allowing you to use them
as keyboards. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for
invoking 1Password to fill logins.</p>

<h3 id="home">✔ Google Home → Apple Home</h3>

<p>My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent building up
our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a Raspberry Pi made it all
work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV showing our Nest doorbell camera
picture-in-picture when the doorbell rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a
Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home Hub.)</p>

<p>The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list that
feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a breeze.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT gateway,
having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center pull-down menus, and
hooking up more devices through automation with Shortcuts.</p>

<h3 id="airpods">✔ Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro</h3>

<p>Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true.
Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my
ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs, even for flights.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775" target="_blank">Spatial audio</a> is literally too good;
I had to turn it off. Again and again I became very nervous that I was blasting
sound from my speakers, so I would have to briefly remove one earbud to ensure
I wasn't. The anxiety of this was so distracting as to be counterproductive.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between devices based
on attention, and a Siri integration slightly worse than Pixel Buds's Google
Assistant integration.</p>

<h3 id="mail">⚠ Gmail → iCloud Mail</h3>

<p>The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I control
anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.</p>

<h4 id="migrating">Migrating Emails</h4>

<p>I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the experience
was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired result. After
starting from scratch several times and hitting new issues every time, I’ve
chosen to live the life of searching in two places when I need something.</p>

<h4 id="migratingaddresses">Migrating Email Addresses</h4>

<p>To migrate email addresses I made a very tough decision that I'm still
frustrated years later that I had to make, which was to change Google accounts.
This is because I want my Google account's primary email address to be the one I give to people,
as small usability quirks abound when it isn't.</p>

<p>For example, I give you my email address, ben@twos.dev.
You invite that email address to a meeting on Google Calendar with an attached Meet meeting.
When I accept, it accepts from my Google account, not from the invited email address, so you see an unknown person added to the meeting, while I appear to have not responded.
When it's time for the meeting, I attempt to join the Meet but get thrown into a waiting room because my Google account wasn't invited by you. Even worse, if you don't show up but the meeting should still happen (let's say a team meeting), I have no way to join.
Google Groups experiences similar problems.</p>

<p>I tried to use a twos.dev Google Workspace account as my primary Google account first but many Google features don't support Workspace accounts,
like Google One,
family sharing,
some security features,
and (for better and worse) some types of data harvesting and therefore ad/search targeting.</p>

<p>So I'm left to creating a new personal Google account with <code>ben@twos.dev</code> as its primary email address.
Signing up to Google without an <code>@gmail.com</code> address is a somewhat hidden option,
but it exists.
You just can't ever fall into the "upgrade" funnel that assigns you an <code>@gmail.com</code> address, because that can never be undone.
And of course, this means you can never use Gmail.</p>

<p>None of this would be so frustrating if there weren't so many things tied to my
Google account, like Maps reviews, decades of chat history, and purchased content.
I desperately wanted to keep my account,
but there's just no way around all the little hiccups.
For a brain like mine that can't handle those, things are as "walled garden" as you'd expect from an Apple product.</p>

<h4 id="daily">Daily Use</h4>

<p>The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve installed
Thunderbird to get by.</p>

<p>Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and has a
solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability issues:</p>

<p>Mail's junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk folder,
even after months of correcting it.</p>

<p>When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud Drive links
instead (Google has this same behavior with Drive), but I've had recipients experience trouble downloading them.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Gmail's search is an order of magnitude better than Mail's.
It's what I miss most.
In Mail, what I'm searching for is often buried beneath piles of things I'm not.
Clicking on results sometimes lands me in the right thread but on the wrong email.
On macOS searches only happen in the mailbox being viewed (e.g. Inbox)
and it takes an extra click to search everything,
which is easy to forget.
(iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by default.)
And when you are done searching and click Inbox to "return home"
the search field doesn't clear,
leading you to a seemingly empty Inbox.</p>

<p>Mail is below average at threading emails:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once in a while, it omits an email from a thread that it shouldn’t have.</li>
<li>When replying to a thread, the sent email doesn't appear immediately in the local
view, which makes it seem like something has gone wrong with the sending.</li>
<li>When marking a thread as "Notify" (a nice feature which forces updates to the thread
to send a push notification even when they're off), emails sent into the thread by you
trigger the push. Even emails from the same platform and app that is in charge of
notifying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mail has a high failure rate for autocollapsing quotes in email replies,
causing some frustratingly long nested quotes in long threads.
Gmail was always good at collapsing them automatically.</p>

<p>Mail is bad at converting text to rich text. For example, it will not automatically
convert markdown-esque lists (e.g. <code>1. Some text</code> or <code>- Some text</code>) to rich text lists.</p>

<p>macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service has a
separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have disparate
feature sets and don't synchronize. iOS Mail does not support filters. I’ve
opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because the iCloud filters can only
check one condition per filter, and I just have my iMac stay awake 24/7.</p>

<p>macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to archive.
Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for any app.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-rebind-dark.png" alt="A screenshot of macOS's Settings.app rebinding a key for Mail.app."/></p>

<p><em>Any macOS app's menu actions (e.g. File → Save) can be [re]bound natively.</em></p>

<p>If you want a Mail-like experience with Gmail as a backend, instead of using
SMTP I recommend <a href="https://mimestream.com" target="_blank">Mimestream</a>; it is written by a former
Apple Mail engineer to have a similar UX but using proper Gmail APIs.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in Spotlight
and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.</p>

<h3 id="calendar">⚠ Google Calendar → Apple Calendar</h3>

<p>I switched to Apple Calendar as both an app and a calendar provider. I'd
forgotten how limited and finicky calendar protocols are at their core. Many
things just stop working when you leave Google Calendar. Folks send me
invitations that don't show, my RSVPs don't make it back to them, and I
sometimes don't receive updates to events. Even unfurling invited mailing lists
into individuals (who can then RSVP individuallly) is specific to Google
Calendar.</p>

<p>I switched my provider back to Google Calendar about 18 months in while
continuing to use the Apple Calendar app. It's a much better experience while
sacrificing virtually nothing in ecosystem benefits. I also get to avoid the
crappy Apple Calendar web UI those few times I need my calendar on Windows, and
I get the more powerful sharing / RSVP tools of Google Calendar.</p>

<p>As for the Apple Calendar iOS and macOS apps, I don't recommend using the Week
view. Like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to
represent the current time of day; but this bar extends 100% of the width of the
week, and does not do a good job showing you which day today is.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-calendar-dark.png" alt="A screenshot of Calendar.app on macOS showing a week with a red line across it."/></p>

<p><em>Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it is?</em></p>

<p>This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing panic
about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar only shows
when viewing today.</p>

<p>Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say they
appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a calendar invitation
there are two attachments, <code>invite.ics</code> and <code>mime-attachment.ics</code>. Each will pop
up a Calendar float to add the event. I don't know the difference; since
switching to Google Calendar as a backend I've learned to RSVP using the
embedded buttons which (outside of Gmail) open a web browser to the Google
Calendar UI.</p>
<p>

    </video>
  </figure>
</p>
<p><em>Opening a Google Calendar invitation from within the Apple ecosystem.</em></p>

<p>Apple Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed to
have a refresh in a decade. Apple Calendar can automatically generate “travel
to” and “travel from” events based on the travel time between locations.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps, Siri suggestions
for navigation destinations and video calls, and the ability to longpress dates and times in iMessage to create events.</p>

<h3 id="maps">⚠ Google Maps → Apple Maps</h3>

<p>Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly so. But
that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved. Unfortunately it’s
only gotten good, not great.</p>

<p>There are UX benefits over Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past
this light, then at the next one, turn <code>$DIRECTION</code>”, but about 5% of my trips
to new places end me at the right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been
routed to the delivery entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an airport,
and the wrong parking lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) for a store in a large
shopping center.</p>

<p>Then there's the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos, menus,
ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here; their purchase
of Yelp means they inherit photos &amp; reviews, but even that can't beat the
sheer volume Google Maps. I've only seen one or two restaurants with ordering
functionality enabled. Many business hours are out of date<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I update them when I
notice, but I'm just one person.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and Calendar,
Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other sources, and Apple
Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming turns.</p>

<h4 id="byemaps">Departure</h4>

<p>I’d like to continue to give Apple Maps chances because I know more data helps, but for tight
schedules I wouldn't chance it.</p>

<h4 id="findmy">✔ Location Sharing → Find My</h4>

<p>I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends and
family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple offering (a
separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one would be happy with
the other.</p>

<p>I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must launch
with intention, but it's a wash for me. I've had several serendipitous encounters
enabled by seeing a friend is close by in Google Maps accidentally.</p>

<p>AirTags and device tracking are the big killer features here, which work
as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one in my bag just to
have peace of mind. The app sends a notification when I leave <code>$DEVICE</code> at
<code>$LOCATION</code>, with easy controls to disable future notifications for any such
combination.</p>

<h3 id="photos">✔ Google Photos → Apple Photos</h3>

<p>Mostly, these two products are equivalent. Apple Photos has more powerful
editing tools but Google Photos has more powerful search. Both have similar
tooling around memories, viewing photos on maps or by year, etc.</p>

<p>Classically, Google has a better web experience and Apple has a better native
experience, meaning sharing photos with others is better in Apple Photos if and
only if you're sharing with other Apple users.</p>

<p>As I've been getting more into photography I've come to like how smooth the
import experience is in macOS<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>insert SD card, Photos.app automatically opens up
to the Import window, I tick "Automatically delete photos after import" and tell
it go, and it's done. I can take the SD card out and the photos will upload in
the background. The Google equivalent isn't <em>hard</em> but it takes more
babysitting,
either messing with the filesystem or leaving the SD card in for the entire duration of the upload
(and in my case, forgetting to retrieve it later).</p>

<p>The migration from Google Photos to Apple Photos was simple, but long. Google
Takeout produced hundreds of gigabytes of exports, which I downloaded onto a Mac
and then imported with Photos.app. Due to Apple's offline-first approach
synchronization
tried to take place while the laptop was closed and charging. This was jarring
at first when trying to babysit the process, as by design it stops performing
well when you start using the machine. When I learned to let go, it showed its
colors.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects include rich support for embeds &amp; commenting in iMessage, and photos
appearing in upload prompts on all platforms (e.g. when uploading an avatar to
some random internet account) with full face search embedded.</p>

<h3 id="safari">⚠ Chrome → Safari</h3>

<p>This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from
bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.</p>

<p>In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the Chrome
chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone applications even
when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go backward or forward slides
the page on/off screen allowing you to peek without navigating, but it
backfires and feels artificial for low-travel anchor links and some
single-page app transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the
navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can't
identify.</p>

<p>When it works it's beautiful and useful, but when it doesn't it's jarring.</p>
<p>
  <figure style="text-align: center">
    <video autoplay loop muted style="max-height: 40em; max-width: 100%">
      <source src="/img/apple-back-dark.mov" type="video/quicktime" />

    </video>
  </figure>
</p>
<p><em>Navigating through history in Safari with swipe gestures.</em></p>

<p>I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced some local-only
webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others.
Meet also supports more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one tab.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff (move a browsing session between
devices smoothly) and the downright bonkers power efficiency of Safari on macOS.</p>

<h4 id="keychain">✔ iCloud Keychain</h4>

<p>When I initially moved to Safari,
iCloud Keychain was not powerful enough to replace my use of 1Password.
It did not support multiple domain names per website,
arbitrary text notes,
or custom names for entries.</p>

<p>As of 2023 September, these problems seem solved.
There are stil some shortfalls,
but <a href="https://simonbs.dev/posts/moving-from-1password-to-icloud-keychain/" target="_blank">Simon Støvring's post</a> helped shore them up;
I've used his locked-notes strategy for non-password things I previously kept in 1Password,
and all is well so far.</p>

<p>However, there are still some small downsides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passwords are accessed from within the Preferences pane of Safari, macOS, or iOS.

<ul>
<li>The difficulty of accessing them can be completely solved using <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4cd82a3e2a5c4fc78b8f1a488c5b76e7" target="_blank">this Shortcut</a>, but it can be awkward to refresh authentication with e.g. an Exchange account, as you cannot have two System Settings windows open at once.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Domain names for passwords are not directly editable, possibly for security reasons. To assign one password to multiple domains, you have to use the same credentials for another website and depend on it to invisibly merge them behind the scenes, which it often does, but in a way that's hard to diagnose if it doesn't.</li>
<li>There's no "Archive" feature, so I have to decide if passwords I <em>probably</em> won't need again should be front-and-center or deleted forever.</li>
<li>Windows support for Chrome exists via an extension that talks to the local iCloud background application, but requires typing a verification code every reboot and sometimes doesn't autofill quickly or at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm hoping these get fixed, but for now I'm happy enough working around them for the benefits.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include
faster and more fluid autofill support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS;
automatic iCloud synchronization,
and easily setup of password groups.</p>

<h3 id="numbers">✔ Google Sheets → Numbers</h3>

<p>To a casual user like me,
Sheets and Numbers are ~identical.
Numbers has a slightly nicer UX for editing formulae and tries to humanize references,
e.g. “Ben age” for a cell in a row with header “Ben” and a column with header “Age”, instead of A:123.
This is nice until headers get long and multiworded, and you use them in long formulae.
Overall it’s a wash.</p>

<p>Google Sheets has a network effect going for it,
so I still use it whenever I need to share a sheet with someone not on an Apple platform.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Numbers include Spotlight integration for quickly opening a sheet.</p>



<h3 id="notes">✔ Keep → Apple Notes</h3>

<p>I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>get out of my way and let me
write. Let me deal with organization later. Keep gives me that. Its layout is hard to
browse and hasn't aged well visually, but it makes up for it with great search.</p>

<p>Apple Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on
shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform notes with rich text
support like headers, tables, monospaced text, etc.</p>

<p>So where Keep is best used as a searchable cloud or swarm of notes, Notes is best used as
a curated and categorized filing cabinet. One note in Notes might be several dozen in
Keep, so the effort spent on curation is not so large, and neither is the impact of
only-okay search.</p>

<p>After moving to Notes.app I jumped around to Org-mode, Bear, and Obsidian,
but ultimately landed up back in Notes.
I only wish there were a non-hacky way to export from it,
but I landed back in Notes despite that absence, not because of it.
(I started jumping around specifically because of it.)</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts,
one-click "upgrade" to a Pages document,
a collaboration UX that spans Messages, Mail, AirDrop, and Reminders,
cross-app drag-and-drop,
and "quick notes" which use OS-wide gestures to capture ideas into a staging area quickly à la <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html" target="_blank">Org Capture</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reminders">✔ Tasks → Reminders</h3>

<p>Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS.
It is simple and powerful.</p>

<p>Reminders can be scheduled to “pop” (send a push notification and become "due") at:</p>

<ul>
<li>A due date</li>
<li>A due date and time</li>
<li>When arriving at a location</li>
<li>When leaving a location</li>
<li>When getting in a car</li>
<li>When leaving a car</li>
<li>When messaging <code>$PERSON</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Reminders can belong to lists (e.g. work vs. personal).
Lists can have sections (e.g. pack bedroom items vs. pack kitchen items).
Lists can be shared,
and reminders within shared lists can be assigned to people.</p>

<p>Reminders can have priorities, notes, URLs, tags, and subtasks.
Reminders can have images attached to them.
Reminders can repeat on schedules.</p>

<p>Reminders are synchronized between devices, even Macs,
so popped reminders show up where you are.</p>

<p>For example, Summer and I share a family reminders list.
On that list is a single reminder that repeats every trash day,
and pops when I arrive home.
It’s assigned to me, so it only pops for me.
But if Summer takes out the trash before I get home, the reminder doesn't pop.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share sheet in
native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in the URL field)
and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder (if any) on my Apple
Watch homescreen.</p>

<h3 id="siri">ⅹ Google Assistant → Siri</h3>

<p>Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can't answer questions
like "What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?" or "Who played Alan in
Tron Legacy?". Its best uses are for deep integrations like setting reminders or alarms.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Siri include interaction with native apps:
setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home devices, etc.</p>

<h3 id="shortcuts">✔ Google Assistant Routines → Shortcuts</h3>

<p>I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most
power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had
around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it to shell
scripts.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-shortcuts-dark.png" alt="A screenshot of a shortcut on iOS."/></p>

<p><em>I use Shortcuts.app to block times on my work calendar based on personal events.</em></p>

<p>As one example, when I wrote in the iA Writer mobile app I would use Shortcuts to
automatically commit and push my writing to twos.dev daily. Because iA
Writer stores files in iCloud, and another iOS app called Working Copy can
interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Working Copy) Pull from <code>twos.dev</code> remote</li>
<li>(iOS) Get contents of folder <code>iCloud/iA Writer/Published</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Write contents of folder to <a href="https://twos.dev/winter" target="_blank"><code>./src/warm</code></a> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Stage <code>./src/warm</code> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Commit <code>twos.dev</code> with message “Automatic commit by iA Writer
sync job”</li>
<li>(Working Copy) Push <code>twos.dev</code> to remote</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could
do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say that my phone is
a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="drive">⚠ Google Drive → iCloud Drive</h3>

<p>Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception. Use it
if you're in the Apple ecosystem, and don't if you're not. The biggest downside
I've witnessed is that iCloud Drive does not have an API. This is not a problem
when running software on a persistent macOS or Windows machine, but for Linux or
for ephemeral machines (e.g. CI) the only option is an unofficial
reverse-engineered solution. This may be the reason I ultimately switch to
something else. I have been trying out Syncthing.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow between
your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for first-party and
some third-party apps to use it as a default data store anyway (e.g. Pages
saves documents there, Numbers saves spreadsheets there).</p>

<p>macOS also pulls a trick where it invisibly queues up actions on iCloud Drive
files that haven't yet fully synced to your machine yet. For example, if you are
on your iPhone and place an image in iCloud Drive, then open a Mac,
the image will show up ~immediately in macOS Finder, before it has finished
syncing. If you try to open the file in macOS before it finishes, the open
action will queue until the sync finishes, then execute. This behavior is nice
compared to the industry standard of trying to open a broken file, but when you
first encounter it with a large file like a video it's easy to perceive it as
OS-level slowness or stalling.</p>

<h3 id="music">ⅹ YouTube Music → Apple Music</h3>

<p>Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:
services.</p>

<p>Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified a lot
of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator workflow that
would move the cursor to my existing library, select and copy a title, then
move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and add the top result.</p>

<p>The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with the
iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app. Navigation is
slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact that it takes too many
transitions to get where you’re going. For details on its UX failings, see <a href="https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem" target="_blank">Jake
from Cinnamon's
post</a>.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration, Spotlight integration, and better
Siri support for playing things handsfree.</p>

<h4 id="byemusic">Departure</h4>

<p>I miss Google Play Music, which solved all my problems. I've softly switched to Spotify
which seems overall better, almost strictly so if it weren't for ecosystem effects.</p>

<h3 id="pay">✔ Google Pay → Apple Pay</h3>

<p>I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me embarrassed to use
it. It was hard to find "the spot" on credit card machines to tap. Apple Pay
feels more spatially generous; once I start hunting for the spot, it's already
been found. It could be because the iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of
the device while Pixels have them in the middle, or maybe the world has just
gotten better at this since then. I'm now using Apple Pay every chance I get.</p>

<p>Of the
purchases I make in Seattle, about 95% of shops and restaurants with counter pay
support Apple Pay, and about 20% of table-service restaurants
do. For online orders, roughly half of the non-Amazon orders I place support
it.</p>

<p>The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first credit card
experience that feels like it was made this century. The app is beautiful,
snappy, and simple. The rewards (2% cashback on everything via Apple Pay, 1% on everything else) are good but beatable; several banks now have universal 2% cashback cards.</p>
<p>

  </figure>
</p>
<p><em>Drilling into Apple Card transactions using Wallet.</em></p>

<h3 id="podcasts">✔ Google Podcasts → Apple Podcasts</h3>

<p>Google Podcasts and Apple Podcasts are very comparable. Google Podcasts has a
bit plainer UI, but they're both good enough.</p>

<p>The biggest upside to Apple Podcasts is the better sorting and filtering of
episodes on a podcast-specific basis. For example, I like Planet Money enough
that I want to listen to every episode, so I have them play from oldest to
newest; most other podcasts I don't care so much and have no hope of working
through their backlogs, so I go newest to oldest. These all interleave
correctly when I hit the podcast-agnostic "Play" button on the homescreen, so
that the correct episodes of each podcast are played.</p>

<p>The biggest downside to Apple Podcasts has been stability. Roughly 1-5% of
the time I go to play a podcast, the player gets stuck loading it forever.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Podcasts include tight Siri support.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a living document.</p>

<p>Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the sum of
its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned is that it’s
the long tail of tiny ecosystem benefits that makes up most of that excess. Not the
two or three things per product I’ve mentioned above, but the dozens that
happen without me noticing that add up to make a more enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are functional
benefits to working in a clean space<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it’s easier to find things, spilling a
liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less dust<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>but the bulk of the
benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways the space feels better and motivates
more.</p>

<p>For now, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would not count
it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell and I'll continue
to document my journey here.</p>

      <title>Why Be Synch­ronous?</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/async.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asynchrony vs. synchrony is a constant struggle. Design meeting or design doc?&#xA;Pair programming or code review? &lt;a href=&#34;thepopin.html&#34;&gt;Pop-in&lt;/a&gt; or Slack message?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Synchrony grants speed, but asynchrony grants efficiency. Like debt each has&#xA;their use, and each can be misused. As engineers we love to spout the good word&#xA;of asynchrony so we can reclaim some time to actually build stuff, but there&#39;s&#xA;nothing like a five-minute conversation to take the place of a weeklong email&#xA;thread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been in a secure war room exactly once in my career, for a week minus sleep&#xA;handling a business-threatening emergency.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Before-tech-OSHA&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Before-tech-OSHA&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In that room we built some of the fastest product&#xA;I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of vomiting onto my keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It solved the problem well.

<p>Asynchrony vs. synchrony is a constant struggle. Design meeting or design doc?
Pair programming or code review? <a href="thepopin.html">Pop-in</a> or Slack message?</p>

<p>Synchrony grants speed, but asynchrony grants efficiency. Like debt each has
their use, and each can be misused. As engineers we love to spout the good word
of asynchrony so we can reclaim some time to actually build stuff, but there's
nothing like a five-minute conversation to take the place of a weeklong email
thread.</p>

<p>I've been in a secure war room exactly once in my career, for a week minus sleep
handling a business-threatening emergency.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Before-tech-OSHA"><a href="#fn:Before-tech-OSHA">1</a></sup> In that room we built some of the fastest product
I've ever had the pleasure of vomiting onto my keyboard.</p>

<p>It solved the problem well. And we spent six months cleaning it up. That both
those statements can be true is oft overlooked by engineers, junior and senior.</p>

<p>Like tech debt, synchrony trades away future velocity for present velocity.
Sometimes you need that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too
useless a task if, in tempestuous seasons, they can only tell us that when the
storm is long past the ocean is flat again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span><em>John Maynard Keynes, <a href="https://amzn.to/3PF7nKz" target="_blank">A Tract on Monetary Reform</a> (1923)</em></p>

<p>If you optimize too much for the future, you'll die before you get there. It's
up to each project, team, org to find the right balance. I recommend asynchrony
by default, with an eye trained on the efforts that really need to succeed in
the present.</p>

<p>Employ synchrony when you need speed, but don’t call a 10-person meeting for
anything that doesn't.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/devices.min.css"/></p>



<p>I'm slow to realize biological correlations.
There are several weird things about my body,
so it's not always obvious that when I eat <code>A</code> it causes poor experience <code>B</code>.
Lots of things cause poor experience <code>B</code>,
and also poor experiences <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>E</code>,
so I'm not always on the lookout.</p>

<p>It took me months just to realize that I didn't always have "stomach issues",
a phrase I'll use as a shorthand for some combination of urgent, painful, and/or frequent poops,
and that they might be fixable.</p>

<p>When my doctor suggested food journaling,
I was diligent about looking for a high-tech solution in the form of a mobile app,
and I found several.</p>

<p>Thus started a cycle:</p>

<ol>
<li>I choose a fantastic mobile app to use for food journaling.</li>
<li>I use it to log every meal and poop.</li>
<li>?</li>
<li>Weeks later, I realize I have stopped logging and completely forgotten about it.</li>
<li>Repeat from 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>As I tried more apps this way,
and became more conscious over time about my falling off the wagon,
I realized my issue was the friction of log entry.
I would be eating among friends,
or sitting down in pain,
and a lightweight thought of "I should log this" would brush over my arm
only to be dismissed<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>"I'll log it when I'm free".
Only when later came, it was still too heavy a process
(and too delayed a gratification)
to convince myself to do.</p>

<p>I realized I needed to remove as much friction from the process as I could.
I would simplify my process so much that that light brushing over my arm would be a strong enough signal to log immediately.</p>

<h2>Product Discovery</h2>

<p>I carried a pen and a folded up piece of paper in my pocket,
writing down everything that went into and out of me,
occasionally copying them into a spreadsheet by hand,
and doing some eyeball analysis<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and later some Python scripting<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>to find problem foods.</p>

<p>I did this because the physical pen would literally poke me whenever I sit down to do my business,
but there was something magical about how the small size of the folded piece of paper forced each log entry to be brief.
That magic allowed me to build a routine around it.</p>

<p>Version 2 was opening the aforementioned spreadsheet on my phone and directly logging there,
but this slog quickly led me to version 3,
an iOS Shortcut placed on my Home Screen that prompts for a single line of text,
which it appends to the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2>Simple Works</h2>

<p>All I'm entering in these lines is plain text like
"Good poop",
"Bad poop",
or a few words describing a food item.
In some iterations,
I didn't even include a date;
order was enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bad poop</li>
<li>Mango lassi</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Taco Bell</li>
<li>CookUnity</li>
<li>Soylent</li>
<li>Good poop</li>
<li>Taco Bell</li>
<li>Whiskey</li>
<li>Good poop</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Bubble tea</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>An excerpt from my v2 spreadsheet.</em></p>

<p>I'm not separating "foods" and "poops" into two categories of thing.
I'm not typing out a bunch of tags or ingredients with every food item.
If I zero in on a food that's too ambiguous<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>say, "pizza"<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>only then will I start logging its components:
cheese, bread, tomatoes.
Until and unless that happens,
simplicity wins.
Keeping the routine going is more important than anything.</p>

<h2>Into Swift</h2>

<p>In the background of all this I'd become more and more interested in native iOS development,
for <a href="/apple.html">several</a> <a href="https://whatsinstandard.com/" target="_blank">unrelated</a> reasons.</p>

<p>After stalling out trying to make an unrelated app with a lot of complexity,
I figured this was the perfect do-over to start simple.
I started learning Swift and SwiftUI again, this time with SwiftData too.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brown-note/id6479333983" target="_blank">Brown Note</a>.</p>

<div class="device device-iphone-14-pro" style="zoom: 0.65; margin-bottom: 2rem">
  <div class="device-frame">
    <img alt="A screenshot of Brown Note showing how a specific food, chai in this case, impacts poops, including percentages of good vs. bad poops that come after." class="device-screen" src="/img/brownnote-correlate.png" style="margin-top: 0"/>
  </div>
  <div class="device-stripe"></div>
  <div class="device-header"></div>
  <div class="device-sensors"></div>
  <div class="device-btns"></div>
  <div class="device-power"></div>
</div>

<p>It was insanely easy to get Brown Note to a stage where I can use it for personal logging.
The complexity all lies in the analytics and insights,
which aren't part of its everyday use cases and so didn't block me from onboarding myself as a user.</p>

<div class="device device-iphone-14-pro" style="zoom: 0.65; margin-bottom: 2rem">
  <div class="device-frame">
    <img alt="A screenshot of Brown Note showing the user some meals they have tracked." class="device-screen" src="/img/brownnote-trackmeals.png" style="margin-top: 0"/>
  </div>
  <div class="device-stripe"></div>
  <div class="device-header"></div>
  <div class="device-sensors"></div>
  <div class="device-btns"></div>
  <div class="device-power"></div>
</div>

<p>This helped immensely with design,
as I would personally use the app several times a day,
noting every rough edge and feature need.</p>

<div class="device device-iphone-14-pro" style="zoom: 0.65; margin-bottom: 2rem">
  <div class="device-frame">
    <img alt="A screenshot of Brown Note showing the user a poop they have tracked, and the estimated inputs (recent meals) to that poop." class="device-screen" src="/img/brownnote-trackpoops.png" style="margin-top: 0"/>
  </div>
  <div class="device-stripe"></div>
  <div class="device-header"></div>
  <div class="device-sensors"></div>
  <div class="device-btns"></div>
  <div class="device-power"></div>
</div>

<p>I'm still in constant development,
but the simple use cases are covered.
As I build out more advanced ones, I'm being cognizant about keeping the logging experience dead simple.</p>

<p>For example,
the app can understand food components
(e.g. <code>latte</code> contains <code>milk</code> and <code>coffee</code>)
but I'm shielding the logging experience from being impacted by it.
When the app needs more info,
it asks asynchronously.</p>

<div class="device device-iphone-14-pro" style="zoom: 0.65; margin-bottom: 2rem">
  <div class="device-frame">
    <img alt="A screenshot of Brown Note asking the user for the ingredients of saag paneer." class="device-screen" src="/img/brownnote-honein.png" style="margin-top: 0"/>
  </div>
  <div class="device-stripe"></div>
  <div class="device-header"></div>
  <div class="device-sensors"></div>
  <div class="device-btns"></div>
  <div class="device-power"></div>

I am white. Summer is Chinese. We are both laughing and I am showing the &#39;sign of the horns&#39;.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me and Summer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people in China this far north don&#39;t really see white people.&#xA;After two weeks walking the busy streets of Harbin,&#xA;which has an (albeit small) international airport,&#xA;I identified only one other non-Chinese person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Daqing, two hours away by car,&#xA;children in the street stopped playing to stare at me.&#xA;At the only Daqing restaurant we went to,&#xA;several tables stared and one struck up a conversation with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer’s family had never met an American,&#xA;but they had been exposed to the worst of the tropes and stereotypes on social media,&#xA;mostly about the extreme political right.&#xA;They were surprised by my kindness, politeness, and sunny disposition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sewage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not omnipresent, but every few dozen breaths carry a sewage smell.&#xA;Chinese plumbing tends not to use traps, which are plumbing tricks that prevent smells from traveling backwards up sewer lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/china-trap.png&#34; alt=&#34;A sketch of two types of traps, which look like capital &#39;N&#39; shapes where the water comes in the top-right of the &#39;N&#39; and leaves the bottom-left of it, leaving the middle section always full with a buffer of water, preventing air from traveling from the bottom-left to the top-right.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traps make pipes airtight but not watertight. (Image: &lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vattenlaas.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nordisk Familjebok, 1921&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traps are all over the place in western plumbing but virtually nowhere in Chinese plumbing,&#xA;and you can tell within a couple of hours of landing.&#xA;Trapless systems can be retrofitted with aftermarket trap-ish attachments,&#xA;but the one we tried drained prohibitively slowly&#xA;so was effectively a manual plug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but you get used to the smell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cameras are everywhere, literally multiple on every street corner.&#xA;People like them because they make them feel safe,&#xA;and indeed walking around the city at night does feel surprisingly safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As someone raised in the US, married to someone raised in China,&#xA;this is the summary on this subject we&#39;ve reached over the years:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People raised in the US value freedom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People raised in China value safety.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People raised in the US are apalled that anyone would live in a surveillance state.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People raised in China are apalled that anyone would live in a gun state.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When people raised in the US go to China, their friends and family worry for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When people raised in China go to the US, their friends and family worry for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pointing this out doesn&#39;t forgive either side for its issues,&#xA;or even claim the issues are equal in importance.&#xA;But it&#39;s interesting to see the same emotions come from concerned Chinese people towards the US,&#xA;as come from concerned Americans towards China.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe both are valid, or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&#39;d opt for the one without a reputation for carefully crafting its own truths.&#xA;But even that reasoning is influenced by where I happened to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would I have the same preference if I were raised elsewhere?&#xA;I&#39;d like to think so, and people who know my neutral good side would agree.&#xA;But we can&#39;t possibly be sure.&#xA;Identifying bias doesn&#39;t disarm it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Sum&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The few weeks we stayed with Summer&#39;s parents in Harbin were educational for me.&#xA;A few things caught me off guard,&#xA;things I&#39;d not heard talked about or even&#xA;things Summer hadn&#39;t consciously realized were different after emigrating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope documenting them has helped you out.&#xA;If so, I&#39;d love to hear about it on &lt;a href=&#34;https://hachyderm.io/@glacials&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Summer for feedback on drafts of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:https-www-theexa&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theexamination.org/articles/how-china-became-addicted-to-its-tobacco-monopoly&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.theexamination.org/articles/how-china-became-addicted-to-its-tobacco-monopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Officially-it-is&#34;&gt;Officially it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_China&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;far more complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;for example, &lt;em&gt;市(shì)&lt;/em&gt; is traditionally the word that translates to &#34;city&#34; but it actually has a lot more nuance&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;but I&#39;m going by the conventional knowledge as I understand it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

<p>Summer and I recently stayed a few weeks with her parents in Harbin, China.</p>

<p><img src="/img/china-harbin.png" alt="A satellite map zoomed out to see most of china. Harbin is circled in the far northeast."/></p>

<p><em>Harbin is near the northern border, far from the popular coastal cities.</em></p>

<p>A few things caught me off guard about the culture.
Things nobody really talks about,
things even Summer remarked that she'd never thought about,
but that affected my stay in subtle ways.</p>

<h2>Natural Refrigeration</h2>

<p>Kitchens this far north use their pantries as natural refrigerators, with the framing of the building set to expose 2<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>3 pantry walls to the exterior.</p>

<p><img src="/img/china-pantries1.jpeg" alt="A photo of the outside of an apartment building, having a vertical slice jutting out with three walls of windows on it."/>
<img src="/img/china-pantries3.jpeg" alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building."/>
<img src="/img/china-pantries4.jpeg" alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building."/>
<img src="/img/china-pantries6.jpeg" alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building."/></p>

<p><em>More exposed surface area means more and faster cooling.</em></p>

<p><img src="/img/china-pantry.jpeg" alt="A photo of a wire rack with vegetables laying on it, like cabbage and green onions."/></p>

<p><em>The pantry can be used to both cool and dry food.</em></p>

<p>Summer shared a half-joke that if you want a cold beer in the winter,
you get it from the pantry.
If you want a warm one, you get it from the refrigerator.</p>

<h2>Hot Water</h2>

<p>People in China drink their water hot, not cold, especially older generations.
The tap water is not potable, so you have to sterilize it by boiling it.
After generations of this, people prefer their water hot<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>even as filtering has become mainstream.</p>

<p>It's even embedded in traditional Chinese medicine that drinking hot water is necessary to restore your body's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang" target="_blank"><em>yang</em></a>,
and drinking cold water should be avoided.</p>

<p>And for what it's worth,
for <em>years</em> after coming to the US Summer would get stomachaches after drinking cold water,
especially on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>Whether physiological or psychosomatic it was clear the routine has an effect on a person,
so I don't exactly blame anyone for the preference or belief.</p>

<p>It was a constant effort to convince her family I wasn't harming myself by drinking cold water.</p>

<h2>Smoking</h2>

<p>Smoking is huge in China.
China consumes about half of all cigarattes globally.</p>

<p>Smoking in restaurants is technically banned, but everyone does it because there's no enforcement.
There's also no incentive to enforce it because tobacco is nationalized, bringing in ~7% of all government revenue.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:https-www-theexa"><a href="#fn:https-www-theexa">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Like hot water, the tradition is stronger in older generations.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>The food was by far the best part of China,
though I've had a few years to acclimate my taste to authentic Chinese food in Seattle and Vancouver.</p>

<p>Some notable items I tried:</p>

<p><img src="/img/china-breadsoda.jpg" alt="A photo of a clear bottle of gold-colored fizzy liquid, with a label depicting a loaf of bread."/></p>

<p><em>Bread soda, with real yeast. My stomach doesn't recommend more than one at a time.</em></p>

<p><img src="/img/china-kaolengmian.jpeg" alt="A photo of a small disposable bowl of wide noodles with veggies mixed in. In the background is a night market."/></p>

<p><em>烤冷面 kǎolěngmiàn ("grilled cold noodles"), my years-long favorite Chinese food.</em></p>

<p><img src="/img/china-youtiao.jpeg" alt="A photo of me, a white man, dipping a long donut-looking item in a cup of soy milk. We are sitting at a table on the street and the sun is rising."/></p>

<p><em>Plain donuts (油条 yóutiáo) dipped in soy milk (豆浆 dòujiāng), a common if unhealthy breakfast.</em></p>

<p><img src="/img/china-pizza.jpeg" alt="A photo of seemingly normal cheese pizza."/></p>

<p><em>Pizza Hut is a pseudodelicacy in China, similar to sushi in the US.
It looks the same, but this pizza uses cream cheese and has a sweet, oily crust.</em></p>

<p><img src="/img/china-kfc.jpeg" alt="A photo of an egg tart in KFC packaging."/></p>

<p><em>KFC sells egg tarts and a few other Chinese items.
Neither of us enjoyed them, but it was interesting exploring international chains' local menus.</em></p>

<p><img src="/img/china-yumilao.jpeg" alt="A photo of yumi lao, which looks like like (and is) a sugary mass of fried corn."/></p>

<p><em>Fried corn fritters (玉米烙 yùmǐlào) are a sweet cross between popcorn, kettle corn, and corn.
If you like those flavors, you'll love these.</em></p>

<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>No one carries cash in China;
businesses universally accept and expect pay-by-phone.
But there’s no tap-to-pay.</p>

<p>Instead, businesses have QR codes posted on their walls that point to WeChat accounts.
The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet,
like a Venmo payment.</p>

<p>A nearby speaker announces incoming payment amounts automatically,
signaling to the shopkeeper that payment was received.</p>

<h2>City Limits</h2>

<p>Before we left Seattle,
Summer kept repeating to me that Harbin is a small town.</p>

<p>What she neglected to mention was that the population of this "small town" was <em>10 million</em>.
At first I attributed the number to China simply having 1.4 billion people,
which is 1.1 billion more than I'm used to conceptualizing.</p>

<p>There's a different explanation though,
and it is caused by a series of imperfect translations:
China has no suburbs.
Everything is city.</p>

<p><img src="/img/china-ny.png" alt="The city limits of New York, NY, USA overlaid on the city limits of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. New York City's city limits are tiny in comparison, only about 2% of the size."/></p>

<p><em>New York City (solid red, superimposed) is ~2% the area of Harbin (dotted red).</em></p>

<p>There is plenty of rural land.
It's just that every square centimeter of it is technically in a city.
Chinese cities have boundaries more akin to US counties or metropolitan areas.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Officially-it-is"><a href="#fn:Officially-it-is">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Beijing more resembles Greater New York<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a conglomeration of over 70 cities<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>than it does New York City.
A similar pattern holds for most Chinese cities.</p>

<h2>Westerners in Social Media</h2>

<p>I'm very white.</p>

<p><img src="/img/china-white.jpg" alt="A photo of me and Summer dressed up at a nice dinner. I am white. Summer is Chinese. We are both laughing and I am showing the 'sign of the horns'."/></p>

<p><em>Me and Summer.</em></p>

<p>Most people in China this far north don't really see white people.
After two weeks walking the busy streets of Harbin,
which has an (albeit small) international airport,
I identified only one other non-Chinese person.</p>

<p>In Daqing, two hours away by car,
children in the street stopped playing to stare at me.
At the only Daqing restaurant we went to,
several tables stared and one struck up a conversation with me.</p>

<p>Summer’s family had never met an American,
but they had been exposed to the worst of the tropes and stereotypes on social media,
mostly about the extreme political right.
They were surprised by my kindness, politeness, and sunny disposition.</p>

<h2>Sewage</h2>

<p>It's not omnipresent, but every few dozen breaths carry a sewage smell.
Chinese plumbing tends not to use traps, which are plumbing tricks that prevent smells from traveling backwards up sewer lines.</p>

<p><img src="/img/china-trap.png" alt="A sketch of two types of traps, which look like capital 'N' shapes where the water comes in the top-right of the 'N' and leaves the bottom-left of it, leaving the middle section always full with a buffer of water, preventing air from traveling from the bottom-left to the top-right."/></p>

<p><em>Traps make pipes airtight but not watertight. (Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vattenlaas.png" target="_blank">Nordisk Familjebok, 1921</a>)</em></p>

<p>Traps are all over the place in western plumbing but virtually nowhere in Chinese plumbing,
and you can tell within a couple of hours of landing.
Trapless systems can be retrofitted with aftermarket trap-ish attachments,
but the one we tried drained prohibitively slowly
so was effectively a manual plug.</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but you get used to the smell.</p>

<h2>Surveillance</h2>

<p>Cameras are everywhere, literally multiple on every street corner.
People like them because they make them feel safe,
and indeed walking around the city at night does feel surprisingly safe.</p>

<p>As someone raised in the US, married to someone raised in China,
this is the summary on this subject we've reached over the years:</p>

<ol>
<li>People raised in the US value freedom.</li>
<li>People raised in China value safety.</li>
<li>People raised in the US are apalled that anyone would live in a surveillance state.</li>
<li>People raised in China are apalled that anyone would live in a gun state.</li>
<li>When people raised in the US go to China, their friends and family worry for them.</li>
<li>When people raised in China go to the US, their friends and family worry for them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pointing this out doesn't forgive either side for its issues,
or even claim the issues are equal in importance.
But it's interesting to see the same emotions come from concerned Chinese people towards the US,
as come from concerned Americans towards China.</p>

<p>Maybe both are valid, or maybe not.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd opt for the one without a reputation for carefully crafting its own truths.
But even that reasoning is influenced by where I happened to be raised.</p>

<p>Would I have the same preference if I were raised elsewhere?
I'd like to think so, and people who know my neutral good side would agree.
But we can't possibly be sure.
Identifying bias doesn't disarm it.</p>

<h2>In Sum</h2>

<p>The few weeks we stayed with Summer's parents in Harbin were educational for me.
A few things caught me off guard,
things I'd not heard talked about or even
things Summer hadn't consciously realized were different after emigrating.</p>

<p>I hope documenting them has helped you out.
If so, I'd love to hear about it on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@glacials" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>.</p>

      <title>Advanced Dashes</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/dashes.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/dashes-supreme.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of a restaurant storefront reading Supreme: New York Style Pizza-Liquor, but the dash between pizza and liquor could be mistaken for a hyphen.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love pizza-liquor, but I&#39;ve never had it New York style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three common dashes in written English:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hyphen : &lt;span style=&#34;“font-family:sans-serif”&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;En dash: &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Em dash: &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hyphen is used to join words, prefixes, and/or suffixes together, like father-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The en dash is used to create ranges, like 2020&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;2030.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em dash can be used as a more powerful parenthetical, a replacement for a colon, or to represent an interruption of a speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;One Size Doesn&#39;t Fit All&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A myth states the em dash is so named because it is &#34;one &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; wide&#34;, and the en dash &#34;one &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; wide&#34;. This is... almost true. The confusing correction is that an em dash is so named because it is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; wide. Incidentally, the en is defined as half of one em; much of my focus will be on the em.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Em&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To talk about the em dash necessitates talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;em&lt;/a&gt;. The em (pronounced &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;/ɛm/&lt;/a&gt;) is a unit of length defined as the height of the character bounding box.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:boundingbox&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:boundingbox&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This height changes with font family and size, so the length of the em changes with it: &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; is always one &lt;em&gt;font-heighth&lt;/em&gt; long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifying a font size in ems, then, is an exercise in ratios. The CSS declaration &lt;code&gt;font-size: 1em&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;font-size: 100%&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;1.5em&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;150%&lt;/code&gt; and so on; the current font size is used as a base to specify the desired font size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em&#39;s eccentric offering is that it can be used outside the context of font sizes. It can set margins, widths, even blur radii based on the font size of the containing context. It can scale an image up and down with the text around it, whether the text&#39;s changing size is a product of assistive technologies or simply of a component being reused in multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em came about in the times of the printing press, when every &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type was large and perfectly square, thus convenient to use as a proportional measurement for a given font and size. When the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type eventually rebelled against being square, the modern em shifted its definition to the remaining constant, the height. At the time this was effectively a non-change, but the updated definition allowed the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; and the em to be decoupled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;The Em Dash&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the tailwind given by the definition of the em, the em dash is easily defined: a dash that is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; long. In a way, the em dash took up the mantle of the square &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type. Because the em dash is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; long, and the em is defined as the height of the font, the em dash&#39;s bounding box is an exact square&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;in any font, at any size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;The Root Em&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;root em&lt;/strong&gt; is a twist on the em. Where the em is defined using the current context&#39;s font size, the root em is defined using the root context&#39;s font size (in a web page, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). This allows escape from relativity hell without reverting to absolutes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;html: 16pt              (default     = 16pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  → body: 1.5em         (16pt * 1.5  = 24pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    → .container: .75em (24pt *  .75 = 18pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      → h1: 4em         (18pt * 4    = 72pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      → p: 1em          (18pt * 1    = 18pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    → footer: 0.5rem    (16pt * 0.5  =  8pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;key:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;context: requested size (calculation = final size)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  → child element&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Aside: The Point&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to define the em in terms of points without defining the point. The point has had a tumultuous and unstandardized history both physically and digitally, but today the world has predominantly settled on &lt;code&gt;1/72in&lt;/code&gt; per point. This varies greatly among displays, devices, and assistive technologies; for example, a 21” 1440p display has more pixels per inch than a 27” 1440p display. To wrangle the variability, there exist new unstandardized concepts like &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskUseDP&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;density-independent pixels&lt;/a&gt; on Android and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design#effective-pixels-and-scale-factor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;effective pixels&lt;/a&gt; on Windows. The tumultuous history, as it happens, hasn&#39;t ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the displays I develop on, I’ve settled on a rough mental framework of “1px of em length per pt” because it’s close enough to true and easy to remember: a 16pt font has a 16px em and is therefore 16px high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advanced usage of dashes unfortunately revolves around avoiding common issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Em Dash Overuse&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em dash tends to be a trap to a new writer. It is sympathetic to stream-of-consciousness writing, wherein the writer is in &#34;append-only&#34; mode&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;thinking not of the structure of the sentence but of what new words may clarify it when tacked on. For people whose writings spring from internal monologues this seems a neat way to avoid adding structure to organic thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organic thoughts have their place in writing, but it turns out spending time perfecting sentence structure pays dividends to the reader. Long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. Because the pre-dash thought may continue post-dash, the reader must keep its grammar and intention in an internal buffer, which&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;can be hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the em dash is a large glyph and hard to go unnoticed. Its use is obvious even in peripheral vision, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page before reading it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Belittled Hyphens&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like &#34;frozen yogurt&#34; its spaces can visually overpower the hyphen: &lt;code&gt;pre-frozen yogurt&lt;/code&gt; looks like &lt;code&gt;[pre-frozen] yogurt&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;pre-[frozen yogurt]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One solution replaces spaces with hyphens (&lt;code&gt;pre-frozen-yogurt&lt;/code&gt;), which may or may not suit the hyphenation. The opposite (&lt;code&gt;pre frozen yogurt&lt;/code&gt;) is another tool in the bag, but the best it can do is shift ambiguity, not remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\LaTeX\)&lt;/span&gt; users can replace each space with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\thinspace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to de-emphasize them relative to hyphens, though the difference is subtle enough that you may also consider elongating nearby spaces:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a pre-frozen&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\thinspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;yogurt time&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\enspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;pre-frozen&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\thinspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;yogurt&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\enspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;time&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\text{a pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt time}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\text{a\enspace{}pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt\enspace{}time}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, the most common tool I reach for is to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a time before frozen yogurt&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s crude, but dependable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Broken Dashes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It&#39;s accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being introduced to join a word split across lines.

may read like the mythical creature &#34;were-wolf&#34; because the em dash looks short relative to the longer spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A solution surrounds each parenthetical em dash with a space on either side, causing its total width to scale up at twice the rate of spaces:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;

Because &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\LaTeX\)&lt;/span&gt; reserves two hyphens for the en dash, it requires three (&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;) for the em.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Output Difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When rendering monospaced fonts, the glyphs for many dashes are virtually&#xA;indistinguishable from each other.

It is meant for phone numbers and other numeric contexts where columnar alignment is required or pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:serif&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:monospace&#34;&gt;Figure dash: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:2em&#34;&gt;867‒5309&lt;/span&gt; ← same as below&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:monospace&#34;&gt;Number:      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:2em&#34;&gt;86715309&lt;/span&gt; ← same as above&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:monospace&#34;&gt;En dash:     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:2em&#34;&gt;867&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;5309&lt;/span&gt; ← longer&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:monospace&#34;&gt;Hyphen:      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:2em&#34;&gt;867-5309&lt;/span&gt; ← shorter&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, my favorite: the &lt;strong&gt;soft hyphen&lt;/strong&gt; is a zero-width, &lt;strong&gt;invisible&lt;/strong&gt; character that (opposite to the hard hyphen) denotes a place the word wrapper is &lt;em&gt;welcome&lt;/em&gt; to wrap. This can be used in the middle of a compound word or long line of inert code to provide a cleaner wrap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;v left page edge            v right page edge&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;|                           |&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;No soft hyphen:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Supercalifragilisticexpialid-&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ocious&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Soft hyphen after &#39;istic&#39;:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Supercalifragilistic-&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;expialidocious&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Soft hyphen after &#39;istic&#39; but no need to wrap:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can see the soft hyphen in action when viewing the article titles of &lt;a href=&#34;async.html&#34;&gt;Why Be&#xA;Synchronous?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;autism.html&#34;&gt;Anonymously Autistic&lt;/a&gt; on a small screen,&#xA;where their respective long words would otherwise break the right margin.&#xA;With soft hyphens we can ensure the word splits when needed, as well as be in control&#xA;of where it splits so it doesn&#39;t happen mid-syllable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dashing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:boundingbox&#34;&gt;&#34;Bounding box&#34; is strong; font designers are free to design outside it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:swung&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=swung+dash&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=swung+dash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

<p><img src="/img/dashes-supreme.jpeg" alt="A photo of a restaurant storefront reading Supreme: New York Style Pizza-Liquor, but the dash between pizza and liquor could be mistaken for a hyphen."/></p>

<p><em>I love pizza-liquor, but I've never had it New York style.</em></p>

<p>There are three common dashes in written English:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyphen : <span style="“font-family:sans-serif”">-</span></li>
<li>En dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span></li>
<li>Em dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The hyphen is used to join words, prefixes, and/or suffixes together, like father-in-law.</p>

<p>The en dash is used to create ranges, like 2020<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2030.</p>

<p>The em dash can be used as a more powerful parenthetical, a replacement for a colon, or to represent an interruption of a speaker.</p>

<h2>One Size Doesn't Fit All</h2>

<p>A myth states the em dash is so named because it is "one <code>M</code> wide", and the en dash "one <code>N</code> wide". This is... almost true. The confusing correction is that an em dash is so named because it is <code>1em</code> wide. Incidentally, the en is defined as half of one em; much of my focus will be on the em.</p>

<h3>The Em</h3>

<p>To talk about the em dash necessitates talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)" target="_blank">em</a>. The em (pronounced <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation" target="_blank">/ɛm/</a>) is a unit of length defined as the height of the character bounding box.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:boundingbox"><a href="#fn:boundingbox">1</a></sup> This height changes with font family and size, so the length of the em changes with it: <code>1em</code> is always one <em>font-heighth</em> long.</p>

<p>Specifying a font size in ems, then, is an exercise in ratios. The CSS declaration <code>font-size: 1em</code> is equivalent to <code>font-size: 100%</code>, while <code>1.5em</code> is equivalent to <code>150%</code> and so on; the current font size is used as a base to specify the desired font size.</p>

<p>The em's eccentric offering is that it can be used outside the context of font sizes. It can set margins, widths, even blur radii based on the font size of the containing context. It can scale an image up and down with the text around it, whether the text's changing size is a product of assistive technologies or simply of a component being reused in multiple contexts.</p>

<p>The em came about in the times of the printing press, when every <code>M</code> type was large and perfectly square, thus convenient to use as a proportional measurement for a given font and size. When the <code>M</code> type eventually rebelled against being square, the modern em shifted its definition to the remaining constant, the height. At the time this was effectively a non-change, but the updated definition allowed the <code>M</code> and the em to be decoupled.</p>

<h4>The Em Dash</h4>

<p>With the tailwind given by the definition of the em, the em dash is easily defined: a dash that is <code>1em</code> long. In a way, the em dash took up the mantle of the square <code>M</code> type. Because the em dash is <code>1em</code> long, and the em is defined as the height of the font, the em dash's bounding box is an exact square<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>in any font, at any size.</p>

<h4>The Root Em</h4>

<p>The <code>rem</code> or <strong>root em</strong> is a twist on the em. Where the em is defined using the current context's font size, the root em is defined using the root context's font size (in a web page, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>). This allows escape from relativity hell without reverting to absolutes:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="cl">html: 16pt              (default     = 16pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 2</span><span class="cl">  → body: 1.5em         (16pt * 1.5  = 24pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 3</span><span class="cl">    → .container: .75em (24pt *  .75 = 18pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 4</span><span class="cl">      → h1: 4em         (18pt * 4    = 72pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 5</span><span class="cl">      → p: 1em          (18pt * 1    = 18pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 6</span><span class="cl">    → footer: 0.5rem    (16pt * 0.5  =  8pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 7</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 8</span><span class="cl">key:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 9</span><span class="cl">context: requested size (calculation = final size)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">10</span><span class="cl">  → child element
</span></span></code></pre>

<h4>Aside: The Point</h4>

<p>It’s hard to define the em in terms of points without defining the point. The point has had a tumultuous and unstandardized history both physically and digitally, but today the world has predominantly settled on <code>1/72in</code> per point. This varies greatly among displays, devices, and assistive technologies; for example, a 21” 1440p display has more pixels per inch than a 27” 1440p display. To wrangle the variability, there exist new unstandardized concepts like <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskUseDP" target="_blank">density-independent pixels</a> on Android and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design#effective-pixels-and-scale-factor" target="_blank">effective pixels</a> on Windows. The tumultuous history, as it happens, hasn't ended.</p>

<p>Based on the displays I develop on, I’ve settled on a rough mental framework of “1px of em length per pt” because it’s close enough to true and easy to remember: a 16pt font has a 16px em and is therefore 16px high.</p>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<p>Advanced usage of dashes unfortunately revolves around avoiding common issues.</p>

<h3>Em Dash Overuse</h3>

<p>The em dash tends to be a trap to a new writer. It is sympathetic to stream-of-consciousness writing, wherein the writer is in "append-only" mode<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>thinking not of the structure of the sentence but of what new words may clarify it when tacked on. For people whose writings spring from internal monologues this seems a neat way to avoid adding structure to organic thoughts.</p>

<p>Organic thoughts have their place in writing, but it turns out spending time perfecting sentence structure pays dividends to the reader. Long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. Because the pre-dash thought may continue post-dash, the reader must keep its grammar and intention in an internal buffer, which<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>can be hard to do.</p>

<p>Separately, the em dash is a large glyph and hard to go unnoticed. Its use is obvious even in peripheral vision, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page before reading it.</p>

<h3>Belittled Hyphens</h3>

<p>When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like "frozen yogurt" its spaces can visually overpower the hyphen: <code>pre-frozen yogurt</code> looks like <code>[pre-frozen] yogurt</code>, not <code>pre-[frozen yogurt]</code>.</p>

<p>One solution replaces spaces with hyphens (<code>pre-frozen-yogurt</code>), which may or may not suit the hyphenation. The opposite (<code>pre frozen yogurt</code>) is another tool in the bag, but the best it can do is shift ambiguity, not remove it.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> users can replace each space with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space" target="_blank"><code>\thinspace</code></a> to de-emphasize them relative to hyphens, though the difference is subtle enough that you may also consider elongating nearby spaces:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt time
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">a<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>time
</span></span></code></pre>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{a pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt time}\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[\text{a\enspace{}pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt\enspace{}time}\]</span></p><p>Personally, the most common tool I reach for is to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a time before frozen yogurt
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>It's crude, but dependable.</p>

<h3>Broken Dashes</h3>

<p>If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It's accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being introduced to join a word split across lines. En and em dashes are a little harder to parse.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓ left page edge             ↓ right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am looking at dates about 20
</span></span></code></pre>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm looking at dates about 20</span></span></code></pre>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am pleased they thought that
</span></span></code></pre>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm pleased they thought that</span></span></code></pre>

<p>Strangely, the hyphen is the only dash that has an option here: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Non-breaking_hyphens" target="_blank">non-breaking hyphen</a> or "hard hyphen" is a hyphen glyph that sends a signal to the word wrapper that a wrap must not happen after it.</p>

<h3>Drowned Dashes</h3>

<p>When using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified" target="_blank">justified text</a> elongated spaces can overpower dashes where non-elongated spaces would not have.</p>

<p>For example, see this simulation of left-aligned text:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓ left page edge             ↓ right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I said they were</span></span></code></pre>

<p>And this simulation of justified text:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I    said    they   were</span></span></code></pre>

<p>In the justified simulation, "were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf" may read like the mythical creature "were-wolf" because the em dash looks short relative to the longer spaces.</p>

<p>A solution surrounds each parenthetical em dash with a space on either side, causing its total width to scale up at twice the rate of spaces:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I   said  they  were  </span></span></code></pre>

<h3>Input Difficulties</h3>

<p>Standard US keyboards support only the hyphen, so many en and em dash users simply compose them from hyphens and spaces.</p>

<p>No one should ever fault that, but for those who are willing to commit something new to memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>macOS

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>⌥ + -</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>⌥ + Shift + -</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>Alt + 0150</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>Alt + 0151</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For all others, read on.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered En Dash</h4>

<p>The en dash looks similar enough to the hyphen in most fonts that people often settle for a single hyphen: <code>2020-2030</code>. <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> requires two (<code>--</code>) for the en dash.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered Em Dash</h4>

<p>A common replacement for the em dash is a space on either end of two hyphens (<code>--</code>). Because <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> reserves two hyphens for the en dash, it requires three (<code>---</code>) for the em.</p>

<h3>Output Difficulties</h3>

<p>When rendering monospaced fonts, the glyphs for many dashes are virtually
indistinguishable from each other. To make the differences visible, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/a61379f9c0f121e9e98033c2a32c3ef47f975f48/winter/document.go#L41-L47" target="_blank">a bespoke
preprocessing
step</a>
to render twos.dev's dashes in a variable width font, even when among monospaced
characters.</p>

<p>I'd love for there to be a "monospace with exceptions" font that takes this chore out of my hands.</p>

<h2>Bonus Round: Esoteric Dashes</h2>

<p>The hyphen, en dash, and em dash get all the love, but behind the scenes are a silent majority of dashes that don't often get to see the light of day.</p>

<p>The <strong>swung dash</strong> (<span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>) is an elongated tilde used to stand in for a word being defined in a dictionary.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:swung"><a href="#fn:swung">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>boot (n)</p>

<p>ex: Let me put on my other <span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>horizontal bar</strong> is a way to introduce quotations. Confusingly, its length is almost always identical to the em dash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">―</span> O Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!</p>

<p><em>James Joyce's Ulysses p. 335</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>hyphen bullet</strong> is a hyphen to be used in place of a bullet point.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">- This is a hyphen
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>The <strong>figure dash</strong> is a variant of the en dash having the same width as digits (which are uniformly wide in most fonts). It is meant for phone numbers and other numeric contexts where columnar alignment is required or pleasing.</p>

<pre><span style="font-family:serif"><span style="font-family:monospace">Figure dash: </span><span style="font-size:2em">867‒5309</span> ← same as below
<span style="font-family:monospace">Number:      </span><span style="font-size:2em">86715309</span> ← same as above
<span style="font-family:monospace">En dash:     </span><span style="font-size:2em">867<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>5309</span> ← longer
<span style="font-family:monospace">Hyphen:      </span><span style="font-size:2em">867-5309</span> ← shorter
</span></pre>

<p>Lastly, my favorite: the <strong>soft hyphen</strong> is a zero-width, <strong>invisible</strong> character that (opposite to the hard hyphen) denotes a place the word wrapper is <em>welcome</em> to wrap. This can be used in the middle of a compound word or long line of inert code to provide a cleaner wrap.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge            v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                           |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">No soft hyphen:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilisticexpialid-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">5</span><span class="cl">ocious
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">6</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">7</span><span class="cl">Soft hyphen after 'istic':
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">8</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilistic-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">9</span><span class="cl">expialidocious
</span></span></code></pre>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">Soft hyphen after 'istic' but no need to wrap:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>You can see the soft hyphen in action when viewing the article titles of <a href="async.html">Why Be
Synchronous?</a> and <a href="autism.html">Anonymously Autistic</a> on a small screen,
where their respective long words would otherwise break the right margin.
With soft hyphens we can ensure the word splits when needed, as well as be in control
of where it splits so it doesn't happen mid-syllable.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body>

<p>Like a programming language,
English's purpose is to taxi ideas.
As well, there are many ways to do the same job,
some more effective than others.</p>

<p>But unlike code,
English presents two roads that ideas can drive down:
the spoken word and the written word.
They lead the same place,
but one is a windy one-lane dirt road full of intersections and backtracking.
The other is a coastal highway.</p>

<p>When we write,
we pave the highway.
We put in an enormous amount of effort up front to benefit people we don't even know will come.
If we instead write as if we are speaking,
the highway is quickly eroded by waters of disinterest.</p>

<p>Here's how to pave a highway.</p>

<h2>Leave Something Out</h2>

<p>Laura Shapiro shares an anecdote in <em>Something from the Oven</em> that box cake mixes<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>the ones where you just add eggs and water<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>at one point embedded the eggs directly in the mix,
dehydrated to be as shelf-stable as the rest.
Consumers merely added water,
but sales were low.</p>

<p>Psychologist Ernest Dichter suggested leaving out the dehydrated eggs and directing the consumer to add their own.
Consumers felt more engaged,
and sales skyrocketed.</p>

<p>Let the reader add their own eggs.</p>

<h2>Writing is Code Golf</h2>

<p>Code golf<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Code-golf-is-a-f"><a href="#fn:Code-golf-is-a-f">1</a></sup> can be fun, but it is infamous for yielding unmaintainable real-world code.
Squishing as much information as possible into as few characters as possible inevitably sacrifices reader understanding.</p>

<p>The better code golf would be to optimize for reader time,
not character count.
That is, measure density as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\dfrac{meaning\,gleaned}{time\ spent\ reading}\]</span></p><p>In writing,
this kind of density means everything.
There is no compiler, scaling, or even syntax to worry about.
There is only the reader.
They float in orbit,
moving from piece to piece until they spot something interesting to land on.
Clear words are like electromagnets that pull them in.</p>

<h2>Be Nontechnical</h2>

<p>Technical ideas can be expressed nontechnically a lot more often than you may realize.
It is a matter of time and effort.</p>

<p>What is a static website generator?
Take ten seconds to describe it in your head before continuing.</p>

<p>Here is mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A static website generator turns documents into websites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is Markdown? Again, try it yourself.</p>

<p>Mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is an agreement on how to indicate rich text in plain text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your descriptions were probably more precise.
Maybe you meandered a little and used some technical terms.
The result of those actions is slightly more meaning,
but it's a lot less understandable to laypeople.</p>

<p>Usually the trade is not worth it.
Readers not in your mindset will be exhausted easily.
Spend the effort to be at least one step less technical than is your instinct.</p>

<h2>Use Imagery</h2>

<p>Recall the seeds planted in you by your grade school training on imagery.
It’s difficult to nurture the habit,
but even a little thought can bloom beautiful prose.</p>

<h2>Instill Understanding, not Correctness</h2>

<p><span class="math inline">\(E=mc²\)</span> is technically wrong. The actual equation for energy is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E=\sqrt{m²c^4 + p^2c^2}\]</span></p><p>where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is momentum.
<span class="math inline">\(E=mc²\)</span> is a simplification that works well enough for human-scale speeds.
But it is still taught in classrooms,
all the way until reaching the point where it breaks down<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>which most disciplines never reach.
It is easier to teach that way.</p>

<p>Mold your concepts to be taught easily.
Do not fret about being correct at the edges.
Do not even mention the edges.
They are a distraction from the teaching.</p>

<h2>Prefer Understanding over Grammar</h2>

<p>A grammar exists to make communication easier.
But the English grammar was not constructed;
it grew and grows organically.
Patterns in sentence structure existed before anyone wrote them down,
and new developments aren't decided by some council of elders.
They're decided by popular use.</p>

<p>The English grammar is a description,
not a prescription.
Grammars and dictionaries are continually updated to match current usage,
not the other way around.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:As-an-example-of"><a href="#fn:As-an-example-of">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Aim to be understood.
Don't let any rule get in the way.</p>

<h2>Use Staging</h2>

<p>Like code, the worst person to test what you've written is you.
Find a friend who enjoys reviewing your work constructively,
or stash the piece in some staging area and look at it in a month with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>You'll learn what works and what makes you bored of reading.</p>

<h2>Give Yourself a Break</h2>

<p>After all this,
it's better to publish something
<a href="/90.html">90% done</a>
than to toil away trying to reach 100% forever.
Give yourself some slack and hit the button.</p>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Fermi paradox is the idea that based on the number of stars in the universe,&#xA;each&#39;s probability of having a habitable planet,&#xA;each of those planets&#39; odds of developing life, and so on;&#xA;statistically it&#39;s virtually certain some other civilization has become obscenely advanced,&#xA;far beyond our own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If such a civilization exists we should have heard from them by now, but we haven&#39;t.&#xA;That&#39;s the paradox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Great Filter is one solution to this paradox.&#xA;It proposes that some big bad event inevitably happens in the course of any developing civilization that dooms it,&#xA;and it&#39;s the same event or events for every civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually, ideas for possible Great Filters are dramatic and looming like&#xA;nuclear war, climate change, hyperintelligent AI, plague, or exhaustion of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to propose some more wholesome alternatives,&#xA;each a little more unhinged than the last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Stopped Having &#34;Happy Accidents&#34;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When speaking about populations, &lt;strong&gt;replacement&lt;/strong&gt; is when the average person produces 1.0 children.&#xA;Mathematically replacement is vital to the continuation of any species.&#xA;An average production of even 0.9 children per person means each generation is smaller than the last,&#xA;until there is simply no next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We already know that as populations develop, birth rates decline.&#xA;Contraceptives, family planning, education, individual freedoms, and opportunity&#xA;all work together to create more thoughtful and intentional reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Historically, reaching replacement has been easy.&#xA;It has had to be.&#xA;Sex is fun, and sex makes children, so children get made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as we approach a world that disconnects recreational sex from conception,&#xA;it&#39;s possible we won&#39;t reach replacement.&#xA;It&#39;s possible we won&#39;t even get &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;How many couples do you know who &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; to have 3+ children?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the largest human generation ever to exist already does.&#xA;It will be a fantastic thing for each individual to lead their life how they want.&#xA;It might also end the species.&#xA;Lack of reproductive freedom is one of the more sinister evolutionary necessities.&#xA;Perhaps once a species advances enough to fix it, it&#39;s the beginning of the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps countless civilizations have already gone through this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Purposefully Stopped Inventing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans are unique on the planet for two reasons.&#xA;First, we’re toolmakers.&#xA;Second, we pine for more.&#xA;More everything.&#xA;The richest and most accomplished among us still want more.&#xA;This carnal desire has brought us far evolutionarily, intellectually, and economically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This desire for excess is probably a prerequisite for any species to become advanced.&#xA;But perhaps that desire eventually causes enough planet-scale issues that it forces the realization that it can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small problem is ignorable and a medium problem is annoying, but a big problem is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll reach some philosophical understanding of the universe and our own nature that shuts down that desire for excess,&#xA;that makes every human being happy and healthy but doesn&#39;t also advance science,&#xA;or at least spacefaring science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If so, civilizations that have those two properties necessary for growth&#xA;are stopped from growing by those very same properties&#39;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body>

<p>The Fermi paradox is the idea that based on the number of stars in the universe,
each's probability of having a habitable planet,
each of those planets' odds of developing life, and so on;
statistically it's virtually certain some other civilization has become obscenely advanced,
far beyond our own.</p>

<p>If such a civilization exists we should have heard from them by now, but we haven't.
That's the paradox.</p>

<p>The Great Filter is one solution to this paradox.
It proposes that some big bad event inevitably happens in the course of any developing civilization that dooms it,
and it's the same event or events for every civilization.</p>

<p>Usually, ideas for possible Great Filters are dramatic and looming like
nuclear war, climate change, hyperintelligent AI, plague, or exhaustion of resources.</p>

<p>I'd like to propose some more wholesome alternatives,
each a little more unhinged than the last.</p>

<h2>Stopped Having "Happy Accidents"</h2>

<p>When speaking about populations, <strong>replacement</strong> is when the average person produces 1.0 children.
Mathematically replacement is vital to the continuation of any species.
An average production of even 0.9 children per person means each generation is smaller than the last,
until there is simply no next generation.</p>

<p>We already know that as populations develop, birth rates decline.
Contraceptives, family planning, education, individual freedoms, and opportunity
all work together to create more thoughtful and intentional reproduction.</p>

<p>Historically, reaching replacement has been easy.
It has had to be.
Sex is fun, and sex makes children, so children get made.</p>

<p>But as we approach a world that disconnects recreational sex from conception,
it's possible we won't reach replacement.
It's possible we won't even get <em>close</em>.
How many couples do you know who <em>plan</em> to have 3+ children?</p>

<p>Perhaps the largest human generation ever to exist already does.
It will be a fantastic thing for each individual to lead their life how they want.
It might also end the species.
Lack of reproductive freedom is one of the more sinister evolutionary necessities.
Perhaps once a species advances enough to fix it, it's the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>Perhaps countless civilizations have already gone through this.</p>

<h2>Purposefully Stopped Inventing</h2>

<p>Humans are unique on the planet for two reasons.
First, we’re toolmakers.
Second, we pine for more.
More everything.
The richest and most accomplished among us still want more.
This carnal desire has brought us far evolutionarily, intellectually, and economically.</p>

<p>This desire for excess is probably a prerequisite for any species to become advanced.
But perhaps that desire eventually causes enough planet-scale issues that it forces the realization that it can be overcome.</p>

<p>A small problem is ignorable and a medium problem is annoying, but a big problem is fixed.</p>

<p>Maybe we’ll reach some philosophical understanding of the universe and our own nature that shuts down that desire for excess,
that makes every human being happy and healthy but doesn't also advance science,
or at least spacefaring science.</p>

<p>If so, civilizations that have those two properties necessary for growth
are stopped from growing by those very same properties' eventual destructive tendencies.</p>

<p>Once overcome, perhaps we'll stop extraplanetary operations and live out our lives on the planet we grew up on,
solarpunk style.</p>

<p>Perhaps countless of civilizations are currently doing this.</p>

<p><img src="/img/solarpunk.jpg" alt="An illustration of a solarpunk landscape, heavy with greenery and windmills."/></p>

<h2>Stunted by our Carrier</h2>

<p>We're only starting to understand the complexity of the gut biome.
It is an entire colony of bacteria<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a civilization<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>that operates inside us in symbiosis.</p>

<p>The bacteria in the biome probably don't know that their world is inside a person,
who lives in an even larger world.</p>

<p>Maybe we're in someone else's gut biome.
In the same way a bacterium doesn't have concepts for a coffee table or a planet,
we could be missing concepts much larger than us<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>outside the visible universe, maybe<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>that
influence our world or galaxy or universe the same way our bodies influence our gut biomes.</p>

<p>Maybe that larger being has some defense mechanism<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>like we
have white blood cells<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>that prevents civilizations from getting into a bad state,
and intersolar operations are a bad state.</p>

<p>Perhaps countless civilizations have already gone through this.</p>

<h2>Left</h2>

<p>Maybe every civilization advanced to the point where they found a way out.
Out of our universe, or our of our spatial or temporal dimensions.
Maybe they discovered time travel and there’s some reason they really wanted to use it, so they time traveled their entire civilization far into the future, like past the heat death of the universe.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s what dark energy is<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>planets or star systems or galaxies that are time traveling from the past into the future, pulling the metaphorical fabric of spacetime up instead of weighing it down.</p>

<p>Perhaps countless civilizations will meet each other on the other side.</p>

<h2>#nofilter</h2>

<p>Maybe everything is perfect and many extraterrestrial civilizations exist just fine,
just not in ways we can perceive,
and maybe they equally cannot perceive us.
Maybe <em>they</em> are what dark matter is.</p>

<p>Maybe there are entire empires spread across the galaxies thriving, but they somehow exist and have always existed in a perceptual level of the universe we don’t even know about,
like how my dog doesn't know about wifi.</p>

<p>Perhaps countless civilizations are out there, existing among us.</p>

<h2>Would It Be Bad to be Filtered?</h2>

<p>Some of these Great Filters would actually be advancements.
It would be great to reach fully reproductive freedom,
or to re-achieve symbiosis with the resources available to us.</p>

<p>It pulls at me, though, that in these scenarios the species will stop existing,
because I really want us to continue existing.
I'm a curious person.
I'm so curious, that even after I'm dead I want others to uncover all my unsatisfied curiosities of physics and the universe,
even if I won't be around to be curious about them anymore.</p>

<p>But that's not my choice to make.
If everyone alive is happy,
and our species dwindles into nothingness because of it…
is that bad?</p>

<p>Maybe countless civilizations have already gone through it.</p>

I become anxious and distracted, but not enough to realize it. I don&#39;t know there&#39;s a problem to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I happen to fix it by tidying my space, I sit down in my chair and feel peace and productivity wash over me.

I am concentrated, ready to take on a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This makes no sense I can gather.

<h2>Anticlutter</h2>

<p>When I'm in a messy space, it gets in my head. I become anxious and distracted, but not enough to realize it. I don't know there's a problem to be fixed.</p>

<p>When I happen to fix it by tidying my space, I sit down in my chair and feel peace and productivity wash over me.

      <title>Inverted April Fool&#39;s</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/hotsauce.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love it when companies call their own bluffs on April Fool&#39;s Day. I like to&#xA;click into their pranks to see where the seam is. Are they &#34;launching a&#xA;new product&#34; but the only page to be found is a press release? Or, is&#xA;there a product page with a disabled Buy button? Sometimes the Buy button&#xA;works, but brings you to a page that says &#34;Fooled you!&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was never satisfied by these seams after witnessing first-hand the gold wacky&#xA;standard: On April 1, 2004, a popular search engine pranked that it was pivoting&#xA;into becoming an email service&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it&#xA;did&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;This was especially surprising in the age before every startup was a data&#xA;company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Gmail was not created to remove a seam from an April Fool&#39;s Day&#xA;prank. It was made independently from April Fool’s Day, and someone decided it&#xA;would be funny to disguise its launch as a prank. But as a bystander the&#xA;effect is the same: it seems that they are calling their own bluffs. There&#39;s&#xA;no &#34;Fooled you!&#34; page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Calling Your Own Bluffs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always wanted more experiences like this, so I built one. I run a website&#xA;called &lt;a href=&#34;https://splits.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Splits.io&lt;/a&gt; whose goal is to help&#xA;speedrunners (people who time themselves playing video games) play faster.&#xA;It&#39;s a niche site, but we have paying customers and about 10k monthly active&#xA;users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For April Fool&#39;s Day in 2020, we launched a full-page takeover introducing a&#xA;feature to help people speedrun faster: the urgent need to use the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We joked that we would ship them a spicy hot sauce which they could use as a&#xA;sort of gastrointestinal negative reinforcement.

The April Fool&#39;s takeover was going&#xA;to advertise a Splits.io-branded hot sauce, and we were going to give it to&#xA;them. I called it &lt;em&gt;Race to the Bottom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Sauce&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t want to deal with actually making or bottling a product like hot&#xA;sauce but you still want one sporting your own brand, the main option is to&#xA;work with a&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;white label&lt;/strong&gt; company, i.e. one that does every step of making a&#xA;traditional product except for the branding. Instead of selling to consumers&#xA;or retailers, they sell to those with a brand and nothing else. This could be&#xA;someone who&#39;s just amazing at branding and needs a supplier, or it could be&#xA;your employer making some commemorative swag, or it could be an engineer&#xA;trying to make a dumb April Fool&#39;s Day joke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A surprising number of household brands use white label products behind the&#xA;scenes, namely store brands. Because the customers of these white label&#xA;companies are often large businesses, there&#39;s not a pressing need for&#xA;self-service like in consumer retail. That means it can take some phone tag&#xA;and email threads to get the relationship hammered out. But still, it works&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;19% of the US economy is made up of white label goods.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:From-statista-co&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:From-statista-co&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily the last few years have seen some self-service white label products&#xA;enter the market, propelled I think by the demand for startup swag. For&#xA;something as niche as hot sauce, though, the best we could hope for was&#xA;partial automation. I engaged with several vendors and ordered sample packs&#xA;from two&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;one via self-service for &lt;code&gt;$25&lt;/code&gt; and one via phone call for free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I made some chips, invited some friends over (pre-pandemic), and got to&#xA;work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/hotsauce-trialing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Several hot sauce bottles around a plate, with part of each bottle poured into a spot on the plate that allows for dipping&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taste testing hot sauces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We selected a hot sauce called Pale Ale Chipotle and the company rated its&#xA;spiciness as 8/10 (no Scoville rating).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Label&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re a small team with no designer, so I cracked open Acorn and spent way too&#xA;long making way too ugly a label.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/hotsauce-label.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A hot sauce label reading &#39;Race to the bottom: A speedrunner&#39;s hot sauce&#39; in the Splits.io colors.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final label for Race to the Bottom. We were also trialing an energy drink, but scrapped it at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The white label company sent me a template with requirements such as how to&#xA;print the volume of the sauce within compliance, and the right proportions for&#xA;the label.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body>

<p>I love it when companies call their own bluffs on April Fool's Day. I like to
click into their pranks to see where the seam is. Are they "launching a
new product" but the only page to be found is a press release? Or, is
there a product page with a disabled Buy button? Sometimes the Buy button
works, but brings you to a page that says "Fooled you!".</p>

<p>I was never satisfied by these seams after witnessing first-hand the gold wacky
standard: On April 1, 2004, a popular search engine pranked that it was pivoting
into becoming an email service<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and then <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html" target="_blank">it
did</a>.
This was especially surprising in the age before every startup was a data
company.</p>

<p>Of course, Gmail was not created to remove a seam from an April Fool's Day
prank. It was made independently from April Fool’s Day, and someone decided it
would be funny to disguise its launch as a prank. But as a bystander the
effect is the same: it seems that they are calling their own bluffs. There's
no "Fooled you!" page.</p>

<h2>Calling Your Own Bluffs</h2>

<p>I always wanted more experiences like this, so I built one. I run a website
called <a href="https://splits.io" target="_blank">Splits.io</a> whose goal is to help
speedrunners (people who time themselves playing video games) play faster.
It's a niche site, but we have paying customers and about 10k monthly active
users.</p>

<p>For April Fool's Day in 2020, we launched a full-page takeover introducing a
feature to help people speedrun faster: the urgent need to use the bathroom.</p>

<p>We joked that we would ship them a spicy hot sauce which they could use as a
sort of gastrointestinal negative reinforcement. But when people clicked Buy,
they did not see "Fooled you!", but a form to enter their payment
information. And when they entered their payment information and pressed
submit, they received a receipt in their inbox. And a charge to their card. A
week later, a package would show up at their door.
We called all our bluffs.</p>

<h2>The Set Up</h2>

<p>I knew I wanted people to receive real hot sauce, and I knew it couldn't just
be any hot sauce from the grocery store. The April Fool's takeover was going
to advertise a Splits.io-branded hot sauce, and we were going to give it to
them. I called it <em>Race to the Bottom</em>.</p>

<h3>The Sauce</h3>

<p>If you don't want to deal with actually making or bottling a product like hot
sauce but you still want one sporting your own brand, the main option is to
work with a
<strong>white label</strong> company, i.e. one that does every step of making a
traditional product except for the branding. Instead of selling to consumers
or retailers, they sell to those with a brand and nothing else. This could be
someone who's just amazing at branding and needs a supplier, or it could be
your employer making some commemorative swag, or it could be an engineer
trying to make a dumb April Fool's Day joke.</p>

<p>A surprising number of household brands use white label products behind the
scenes, namely store brands. Because the customers of these white label
companies are often large businesses, there's not a pressing need for
self-service like in consumer retail. That means it can take some phone tag
and email threads to get the relationship hammered out. But still, it works<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>19% of the US economy is made up of white label goods.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:From-statista-co"><a href="#fn:From-statista-co">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Luckily the last few years have seen some self-service white label products
enter the market, propelled I think by the demand for startup swag. For
something as niche as hot sauce, though, the best we could hope for was
partial automation. I engaged with several vendors and ordered sample packs
from two<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>one via self-service for <code>$25</code> and one via phone call for free.</p>

<p>Then I made some chips, invited some friends over (pre-pandemic), and got to
work.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hotsauce-trialing.jpg" alt="Several hot sauce bottles around a plate, with part of each bottle poured into a spot on the plate that allows for dipping"/></p>

<p>Taste testing hot sauces.</p>

<p>We selected a hot sauce called Pale Ale Chipotle and the company rated its
spiciness as 8/10 (no Scoville rating).</p>

<h3>The Label</h3>

<p>We're a small team with no designer, so I cracked open Acorn and spent way too
long making way too ugly a label.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hotsauce-label.jpeg" alt="A hot sauce label reading 'Race to the bottom: A speedrunner's hot sauce' in the Splits.io colors."/></p>

<p>The final label for Race to the Bottom. We were also trialing an energy drink, but scrapped it at the last minute.</p>

<p>The white label company sent me a template with requirements such as how to
print the volume of the sauce within compliance, and the right proportions for
the label. They took care of the nutrition facts and bar code.</p>

<h2>Launch Day</h2>

<p>We set up everything to happen automatically. The code had been deployed days
earlier, with JavaScript just waiting for the day to tick over before doing
the takeover. The announcement tweet was scheduled ahead of time as well.
The response when the clock struck midnight was exactly as we hoped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>its actually real wtf</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Dark (@DarkRTA)
<a href="https://twitter.com/DarkRTA/status/1245495897875759108" target="_blank">April 1, 2020</a></p>

A third person says 'whoa you got yours already? nice. i can't believe it's real lol. @Glacials the madman'"/></p>

<p>Feedback during and after launch.</p>

<h3>Shipping</h3>

<p>I went into this expecting to make bulk trips to the post office, but I
actually never had to leave the house<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>usps.com allows you to schedule a
mail carrier to pick up packages during their mail route. I had padded
flat-rate envelopes ready, also delivered from their website. On April 1st,
here was my pipeline:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Trigger) Receive “payment completed” email from Stripe</li>
<li>Pay for a shipping label at usps.com (~<code>$9</code>)</li>
<li>Print shipping label, affix to a padded envelope with scotch tape</li>
<li>Pack in hot sauce and extra packing material</li>
<li>Schedule a pickup at usps.com</li>
<li>(On pickup day) Put queued package(s) on the porch</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Surprises</h2>

<p>I built the full-page takeover to check if the day was April 1 when deciding
whether to take over or lie dormant, but I didn't think about checking the
year. So one year later, we suddenly got another influx of orders. Luckily I
still had plenty of stock with expiration dates still over a year away, so
spent a little surprise day packing hot sauce again<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and again a third time,
another year later.</p>

<h2>Finances</h2>

<p>After the sample packs and the bulk order of 48 bottles (the minimum), upfront
costs came to <code>$192.05</code>. Over three April Fool's Days we sold 28 bottles in 25
orders at <code>$15</code> / bottle.</p>

<p>The cost of my labor and the boon to the brand are harder to calculate. I'll
call them a wash.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="cl">Revenue
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 2</span><span class="cl">Orders: $15*28   =  $ 420.00
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 3</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 4</span><span class="cl">Costs
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 5</span><span class="cl">Samples:           ($  25.00)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 6</span><span class="cl">Hot sauce:         ($ 167.05)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 7</span><span class="cl">Shipping: $9*25  = ($ 225.00)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 8</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 9</span><span class="cl">Profit/loss ----------------
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">10</span><span class="cl">                    $   2.95
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>I'll take it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Getting paid <code>$2.95</code> to live out a minor dream of building a seamless April Fool's
Day joke was a great deal. I'd have paid a lot more just for the joy of seeing
people's reactions in real time.</p>

<p>On the way, I learned how white labels work and how big a slice of the economy
they make up, which has changed how I think about brands. Sometimes you have to
be a little wacky to learn something new about the world.</p>

      <title>Inside twos.dev</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/meta.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a unique advantage in working on twos.dev over anything I’ve worked on: it has just one developer, me. I can therefore design the developer experience in obnoxious and unintuitive ways to serve my peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I decided to ruthlessly optimize for two goals:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must be easy to publish writing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As long as I&#39;m alive, URLs must not change&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some ways these goals work against each other; easy creation usually means easy destruction. So I divide my content into two types, warm and cold. Warm content is easy to create and edit, while cold content is hard to break.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Warm Content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to write drafts in my notes app then migrate to HTML when the piece became less amorphous; from then on I would write and edit directly in HTML. This was surprisingly refreshing as it allowed me to have wild one-off customizations for individual posts, but it had three problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Writing HTML is a rough context switch (what was scribbling drafts on my phone became sitting at my computer in &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Writing was slowed down by cruft like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reading experience can flow differently on a web page than in a notes app, leading to large rewrites after transferring&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To solve these issues and work towards my first goal, I needed tooling in the space between amorphous notes and strict HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first focused on changing my drafting app to something with more robust exporting&#xA;tools. I&#39;ve jumped between &lt;a href=&#34;https://ia.net/writer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt; and&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, both of which let me get my thoughts out quickly, each&#xA;with their own strengths. Importantly, they store writing as Markdown. This solves &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;and &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To solve &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, we need to automate getting those rough drafts published to an unlisted&#xA;twos.dev page every time they change. This means we need programmatic access to the&#xA;drafts, but neither app has a third-party web API. Luckily, the editors can store the&#xA;files in the location of your choosing, including some natively supported cloud storage&#xA;services. We need to get at those files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to do this. The simplest would be to point your writing &#34;vault&#34;&#xA;directly at a cloud storage service with an API like Google Drive, then use something&#xA;like a cron-based GitHub Actions workflow to ensure your writing always gets published.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I&#39;m still undergoing &lt;a href=&#34;apple.html&#34;&gt;my Apple experiment&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve set myself a&#xA;constraint of only using iCloud Drive for cloud storage, which doesn&#39;t have an API. That&#xA;leaves two options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;iOS and macOS ship with&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, a no-code&#xA;event-driven automation app. Using Shortcuts, I set up an automation that triggers when&#xA;I switch away from the my writing app, and additionally on a cron. The automation adds a&#xA;1-2 line &lt;a href=&#34;winter.html#frontmatter&#34;&gt;Winter frontmatter&lt;/a&gt; section to each document if&#xA;needed, then pushes it to the &lt;code&gt;src/warm&lt;/code&gt; directory in the twos.dev Git repository by&#xA;invoking &lt;a href=&#34;https://workingcopyapp.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt;. No interruption to UX; this happens&#xA;in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never thought a phone would be an integral part of my CI/CD pipeline, but here we are.&#xA;It actually hummed along in the background for several months until an iOS update&#xA;changed some minor behavior somewhere that broke it. I didn&#39;t have the motivation to fix&#xA;it because the debugging experience for Shortcuts isn&#39;t great, but otherwise this was a&#xA;surprisingly effective solution and it always triggered exactly when it was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That leads us to our second option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no network API into iCloud Drive, but there is a local one: the filesystem. If&#xA;we control a Mac that will be online enough to satisfy our synchronization needs, which&#xA;are not necessarily 24/7, we can snatch the files from there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enter&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-CH1-SW2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;launchd&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;a hidden gem of macOS. It&#39;s a few things, but for our purposes it&#39;s basically cron&#xA;purpose-built for laptops. It intelligently handles sleep, network loss, and (&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-is-power-nap-mh40773/mac&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;charge&#xA;state&lt;/a&gt;). The&#xA;specifics aren&#39;t important; suffice it to say It Just Works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as we install this on a machine or machines that get enough use&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;or that are&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://caffeinated.app&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Caffeinated&lt;/a&gt; enough&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;this will be a good enough pipeline. We&#xA;have our draft synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On push, GitHub Actions builds the Markdown file into HTML with all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/c59cc1a/winter/document.go#L408-L436&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;right preprocessing&lt;/a&gt; required to make it look like twos.dev. I use a small subset of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.go.dev/html/template&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;html/template&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow myself to put things like MP4 screen recordings and dark-mode-aware images into Markdown. This is also where the frontmatter from before is stripped and parsed into metadata inserted elsewhere on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically at this point the page is now published, just not linked to from anywhere. I can see how it looks in the context of twos.dev, and send the link to friends who have offered to review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cold Content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 2-3 needs warm content doesn&#39;t cover: first, this odd pipeline that uses my phone for CI is not something I have high confidence in, so I&#39;d like to limit its blast radius to content that benefits from it&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;content I&#39;m actively working on&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;and keep safe the innocent bystanders that are historical content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, once in a while I need some wacky one-off piece of code for a single post, like the CSS-only spectrum in &lt;a href=&#34;autism.html&#34;&gt;Anonymously Autistic&lt;/a&gt; or the variable-width font requirements of &lt;a href=&#34;dashes.html&#34;&gt;Advanced Dashes&lt;/a&gt;. iA Writer is great for prose, but when it&#39;s time to write code I need to be back in &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold content exists to serve these needs. At the most basic level, cold content is just warm content that has been moved to a directory outside the reach of the warm pipeline. This is content I only touch with &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;, like a normal code repository.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fully turn warm content cold, there is a small amount of bookkeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Winter&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To handle this bookkeeping along with the other build pipeline steps, I wrote the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twos.dev/winter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Winter&lt;/a&gt; CLI. Winter can handle the process of converting warm content to cold like so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;winter freeze DOCUMENT&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which more or less performs a &lt;code&gt;git mv src/{cold,warm}/DOCUMENT.md&lt;/code&gt; plus chips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winter also handles all the static generation. Writing my own generator was an&#xA;important step in building longevity into twos.dev because I often switch tools&#xA;when I discover a small feature I want but don&#39;t have (put simply: &#34;oo shiny&#34;)&#xA;and that switching of tools is what eventually erodes the content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many static site generators are open source, but I&#39;ll often prefer to switch&#xA;tools than learn how to contribute if the barrier to entry contribution is&#xA;high, such as a language I don&#39;t like writing or an overly complex architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing the generator myself guarantees that barrier is minimal. Writing it in&#xA;Go is a guarantee the code will not rot quickly or fall into dependency hell&#xA;after a few years without attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Post-freeze&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After freezing my content I may also take one final step of permanently&#xA;rendering it to HTML if I&#39;ve built more than a little code into it. Sure I can&#xA;always embed HTML in Markdown, but taking this extra step gives me all my editor&#xA;doodads and hardens the file against future changes to preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;winter build&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;mv dist/DOCUMENT.html src/cold/DOCUMENT.html&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git rm src/cold/DOCUMENT.md&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git add src/cold/DOCUMENT.html&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This brings back the weight of editing prose in HTML, but these cases are the minority and at this point most of the writing is done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allowing myself this escape hatch is freeing.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body>

<p>There's a unique advantage in working on twos.dev over anything I’ve worked on: it has just one developer, me. I can therefore design the developer experience in obnoxious and unintuitive ways to serve my peculiarities.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to ruthlessly optimize for two goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>It must be easy to publish writing</li>
<li>As long as I'm alive, URLs must not change</li>
</ol>

<p>In some ways these goals work against each other; easy creation usually means easy destruction. So I divide my content into two types, warm and cold. Warm content is easy to create and edit, while cold content is hard to break.</p>

<h2>Warm Content</h2>

<p>I used to write drafts in my notes app then migrate to HTML when the piece became less amorphous; from then on I would write and edit directly in HTML. This was surprisingly refreshing as it allowed me to have wild one-off customizations for individual posts, but it had three problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Writing HTML is a rough context switch (what was scribbling drafts on my phone became sitting at my computer in <code>$EDITOR</code>)</li>
<li>Writing was slowed down by cruft like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code></li>
<li>The reading experience can flow differently on a web page than in a notes app, leading to large rewrites after transferring</li>
</ol>

<p>To solve these issues and work towards my first goal, I needed tooling in the space between amorphous notes and strict HTML.</p>

<p>I first focused on changing my drafting app to something with more robust exporting
tools. I've jumped between <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank">iA Writer</a> and
<a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, both of which let me get my thoughts out quickly, each
with their own strengths. Importantly, they store writing as Markdown. This solves <code>1</code>
and <code>2</code> above.</p>

<p>To solve <code>3</code>, we need to automate getting those rough drafts published to an unlisted
twos.dev page every time they change. This means we need programmatic access to the
drafts, but neither app has a third-party web API. Luckily, the editors can store the
files in the location of your choosing, including some natively supported cloud storage
services. We need to get at those files.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this. The simplest would be to point your writing "vault"
directly at a cloud storage service with an API like Google Drive, then use something
like a cron-based GitHub Actions workflow to ensure your writing always gets published.</p>

<p>Since I'm still undergoing <a href="apple.html">my Apple experiment</a>, I've set myself a
constraint of only using iCloud Drive for cloud storage, which doesn't have an API. That
leaves two options.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>iOS and macOS ship with
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752" target="_blank">Shortcuts</a>, a no-code
event-driven automation app. Using Shortcuts, I set up an automation that triggers when
I switch away from the my writing app, and additionally on a cron. The automation adds a
1-2 line <a href="winter.html#frontmatter">Winter frontmatter</a> section to each document if
needed, then pushes it to the <code>src/warm</code> directory in the twos.dev Git repository by
invoking <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com" target="_blank">Working Copy</a>. No interruption to UX; this happens
in the background.</p>

<p>I never thought a phone would be an integral part of my CI/CD pipeline, but here we are.
It actually hummed along in the background for several months until an iOS update
changed some minor behavior somewhere that broke it. I didn't have the motivation to fix
it because the debugging experience for Shortcuts isn't great, but otherwise this was a
surprisingly effective solution and it always triggered exactly when it was needed.</p>

<p>That leads us to our second option.</p>

<h3><code>launchd</code></h3>

<p>There's no network API into iCloud Drive, but there is a local one: the filesystem. If
we control a Mac that will be online enough to satisfy our synchronization needs, which
are not necessarily 24/7, we can snatch the files from there.</p>

<p>Enter
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-CH1-SW2" target="_blank">launchd</a>,
a hidden gem of macOS. It's a few things, but for our purposes it's basically cron
purpose-built for laptops. It intelligently handles sleep, network loss, and (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-is-power-nap-mh40773/mac" target="_blank">charge
state</a>). The
specifics aren't important; suffice it to say It Just Works.</p>

<p>As long as we install this on a machine or machines that get enough use<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>or that are
<a href="https://caffeinated.app" target="_blank">Caffeinated</a> enough<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>this will be a good enough pipeline. We
have our draft synchronization.</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>

<p>On push, GitHub Actions builds the Markdown file into HTML with all the <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/c59cc1a/winter/document.go#L408-L436" target="_blank">right preprocessing</a> required to make it look like twos.dev. I use a small subset of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/html/template" target="_blank"><code>html/template</code></a> to allow myself to put things like MP4 screen recordings and dark-mode-aware images into Markdown. This is also where the frontmatter from before is stripped and parsed into metadata inserted elsewhere on the page.</p>

<p>Technically at this point the page is now published, just not linked to from anywhere. I can see how it looks in the context of twos.dev, and send the link to friends who have offered to review.</p>

<h2>Cold Content</h2>

<p>There are 2-3 needs warm content doesn't cover: first, this odd pipeline that uses my phone for CI is not something I have high confidence in, so I'd like to limit its blast radius to content that benefits from it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>content I'm actively working on<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and keep safe the innocent bystanders that are historical content.</p>

<p>Second, once in a while I need some wacky one-off piece of code for a single post, like the CSS-only spectrum in <a href="autism.html">Anonymously Autistic</a> or the variable-width font requirements of <a href="dashes.html">Advanced Dashes</a>. iA Writer is great for prose, but when it's time to write code I need to be back in <code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>

<p>Cold content exists to serve these needs. At the most basic level, cold content is just warm content that has been moved to a directory outside the reach of the warm pipeline. This is content I only touch with <code>$EDITOR</code>, like a normal code repository.</p>

<p>To fully turn warm content cold, there is a small amount of bookkeeping.</p>

<h3>Winter</h3>

<p>To handle this bookkeeping along with the other build pipeline steps, I wrote the <a href="https://twos.dev/winter" target="_blank">Winter</a> CLI. Winter can handle the process of converting warm content to cold like so:</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">winter freeze DOCUMENT
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>which more or less performs a <code>git mv src/{cold,warm}/DOCUMENT.md</code> plus chips.</p>

<p>Winter also handles all the static generation. Writing my own generator was an
important step in building longevity into twos.dev because I often switch tools
when I discover a small feature I want but don't have (put simply: "oo shiny")
and that switching of tools is what eventually erodes the content.</p>

<p>Many static site generators are open source, but I'll often prefer to switch
tools than learn how to contribute if the barrier to entry contribution is
high, such as a language I don't like writing or an overly complex architecture.</p>

<p>Writing the generator myself guarantees that barrier is minimal. Writing it in
Go is a guarantee the code will not rot quickly or fall into dependency hell
after a few years without attention.</p>

<h3>Post-freeze</h3>

<p>After freezing my content I may also take one final step of permanently
rendering it to HTML if I've built more than a little code into it. Sure I can
always embed HTML in Markdown, but taking this extra step gives me all my editor
doodads and hardens the file against future changes to preprocessing.</p>

<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">winter build
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">mv dist/DOCUMENT.html src/cold/DOCUMENT.html
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">git rm src/cold/DOCUMENT.md
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">git add src/cold/DOCUMENT.html
</span></span></code></pre>

<p>This brings back the weight of editing prose in HTML, but these cases are the minority and at this point most of the writing is done.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Allowing myself this escape hatch is freeing. I’m more encouraged to write interactive or otherwise bespoke components, and twos.dev becomes consistent by default but in a way I can break when I need (e.g. for a <a href="cv.html">CV</a>'s bicolumnar layout).</p>

<h2>On URLs Not Changing</h2>

<p>I use my website as a test bed for interesting technology. As a side effect, content has been lost over the years as it becomes hard to migrate to overhauled versions.</p>

<p>It so happens that by keeping my writing in Markdown or raw HTML/CSS, I make it easy to accomplish my second goal: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI" target="_blank">cool URLs don’t change</a>. I've removed the possibility that changing frontend or backend frameworks will leave my documents behind; Markdown is not going anywhere, and all the HTML files need to look decent is a header and footer. In the worst case scenario I'll simply <code>cp -r dist</code> to my next crazy system's web root.</p>

<p>If I’ve done things right, this web page will be accessible at twos.dev/meta.html for at least as long as I live.</p>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a small number of products in my life that, in little ways, are&#xA;life-changing. These are them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;5.11 Belt&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wear a belt every day.&#xA;I used to buy a new one every 1&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;2 years,&#xA;then I got &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3ptyErI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this belt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was 10 years ago.&#xA;I have worn it &amp;gt; 95% of days since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear.&#xA;I expect I will never buy another belt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3ptyErI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; /&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.511tactical.com/tdu-belt-15-plastic-buckle.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;5.11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Micro Four Thirds&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For photography folks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Micro Four Thirds is a camera and lens conector.&#xA;Unlike most proprietary systems,&#xA;it&#39;s an open standard with many companies participating.&#xA;The de facto flagships are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its biggest advantage is its high &lt;code&gt;photo quality : gear size&lt;/code&gt; ratio.&#xA;My archenemy is not having my camera with me;&#xA;every time I have to settle for my phone camera I question having a camera at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can fit my setup in ~half the space as before.&#xA;That means a full-day setup in a 20L backpack,&#xA;a camera + couple lenses in a 6L sling,&#xA;or a camera + lens in a 2L chest pouch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III&#xA;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3PtUO81&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; /&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OM System&lt;/a&gt;).&#xA;My everyday versatile lens is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3FxQYEP&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Olympus M.Zuiko 14&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;150mm F4.0&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;5.6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;A Long, Mountable Power Strip&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mounting a hilariously long power strip under every desk in my house,&#xA;paired with &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;any cheap&lt;/a&gt; cable basket,&#xA;has given me the best and easiest cable management I&#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s important to overbudget your outlets by ~2x and to go long, not fat,&#xA;so cables can plug in where they are instead of playing musical chairs with a rat&#39;s nest of wall warts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any will do, but I use these: &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/44e4c3W&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; /&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kungfukingsocket.com/products/power-strip-6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KungFuKingSocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Noctua Fans&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&#34;autism.html&#34;&gt;noise-sensitive&lt;/a&gt; person whose hobbies involve computers,&#xA;silence is important to me in a gaming machine.&#xA;Noctua makes giant, silent, brown fans. That&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once I got one I could never switch back.&#xA;My build is centered around their obnoxiously large &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3pyrIJU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fanned heatsink&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and has been purring for six years.&#xA;I expect to reuse the same fans for my next build, whenever it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3LR2Y7J&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Jetz Scrubz Sponges&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These kitchen sponges are easily a 10x&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;100x improvement over the traditional sponges,&#xA;in all of these categories:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lifespan before getting damaged&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lifespan before getting permanently gross&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tendancy to get temporarily gross&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ease of cleaning once temporarily gross&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re pricier upfront, but cheaper long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/46nSjKq&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Bidets&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone came up to you in the street and smeared poop all over you,&#xA;would you wipe it off with a paper towel, or would you take a shower?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I tried one, I had three fundamental misunderstandings about bidets:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bidets are separate from toilets.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bidets are expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s a big deal to install a bidet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;None of these is true.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;It takes about 15 minutes to install a bidet onto your toilet,&#xA;and you can get one for &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3McRz2a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;under fifty bucks&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;It&#39;s just a piece of plastic that goes between the toilet and the seat.&#xA;You do not need to put your hands inside the toilet bowl to install it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bidets pay for themselves in unused toilet paper.&#xA;I use between 1&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;10% of the toilet paper I used before.&#xA;Its only function now is drying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bidets feel weird for about 10 seconds, then never again.&#xA;It&#39;s honestly disgusting &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use one now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Buy whichever one makes you try it, but here are some options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;($) &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3McRz2a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Attachment&lt;/a&gt;:&#xA;Simple, replaces nothing about your toilet, sprays cold water only.&#xA;I promise it doesn&#39;t feel like a cold shower.&#xA;That area of your body doesn&#39;t experience temperature the same.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;($$) &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3PYqFwc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Seat&lt;/a&gt;:&#xA;The weight distribution of my seat got worse with just an attachment,&#xA;so a combination seat/bidet is something to consider if that bugs you.&#xA;Otherwise, the functions are ~the same as the attachment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;($$$) &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3S9PBn9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Air Dry&lt;/a&gt;;&#xA;Seats that plug in jump in price and feature set drastically,&#xA;but I think air dry is the only big one to consider.&#xA;Warm water is overrated.&#xA;If you&#39;re not sure if you need a heated seat, you don&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;In Search Of&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m in search of a life-changing product for these categories. Please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:ben@twos.dev&#34;&gt;email&#xA;me&lt;/a&gt; if you have recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Water Bottle&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am in search of a reusable water bottle with the following qualities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can last 10+ years&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can last a week of no washing without getting funky&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is less than ~9cm in diameter (i.e. a comfortable size for a Peak Design Everyday&#xA;Backpack V1 20L cup holder)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Holds about 1L&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attached or attachable lid&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ability to stay cold ~1 day preferred&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closest I ever came was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/42XJaoR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thermos Element 5 32 oz&lt;/a&gt;, but&#xA;I lost mine and the product has since discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Hair Trimmer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am in search of a combination beard and head trimmer with these qualities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can last 3+ years&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;USB-C chargeable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Has two or fewer attachments, or a good organization system for attachments&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can trim beards in the 1~6mm range&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can trim head hair in the 1~3cm range&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Requires no more than two passes for reasonable coverage&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closest I&#39;ve found in my research is the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3rFxMBB&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MANSCAPED Beard Hedger&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;but it seems to need five or more passes for good coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

<p>There are a small number of products in my life that, in little ways, are
life-changing. These are them.</p>

<h2>5.11 Belt</h2>

<p>I wear a belt every day.
I used to buy a new one every 1<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2 years,
then I got <a href="https://amzn.to/3ptyErI" target="_blank">this belt</a>.</p>

<p>That was 10 years ago.
I have worn it &gt; 95% of days since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear.
I expect I will never buy another belt.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3ptyErI" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://www.511tactical.com/tdu-belt-15-plastic-buckle.html" target="_blank">5.11</a></p>

<h2>Micro Four Thirds</h2>

<p>For photography folks.</p>

<p>Micro Four Thirds is a camera and lens conector.
Unlike most proprietary systems,
it's an open standard with many companies participating.
The de facto flagships are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.</p>

<p>Its biggest advantage is its high <code>photo quality : gear size</code> ratio.
My archenemy is not having my camera with me;
every time I have to settle for my phone camera I question having a camera at all.</p>

<p>Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can fit my setup in ~half the space as before.
That means a full-day setup in a 20L backpack,
a camera + couple lenses in a 6L sling,
or a camera + lens in a 2L chest pouch.</p>

<p>I'm using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III
(<a href="https://amzn.to/3PtUO81" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii" target="_blank">OM System</a>).
My everyday versatile lens is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3FxQYEP" target="_blank">Olympus M.Zuiko 14<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>150mm F4.0<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>5.6</a>.</p>

<h2>A Long, Mountable Power Strip</h2>

<p>Mounting a hilariously long power strip under every desk in my house,
paired with <a href="https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa" target="_blank">any cheap</a> cable basket,
has given me the best and easiest cable management I've ever had.</p>

<p>It's important to overbudget your outlets by ~2x and to go long, not fat,
so cables can plug in where they are instead of playing musical chairs with a rat's nest of wall warts.</p>

<p>Any will do, but I use these: <a href="https://amzn.to/44e4c3W" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://kungfukingsocket.com/products/power-strip-6" target="_blank">KungFuKingSocket</a></p>

<h2>Noctua Fans</h2>

<p>As a <a href="autism.html">noise-sensitive</a> person whose hobbies involve computers,
silence is important to me in a gaming machine.
Noctua makes giant, silent, brown fans. That's it.</p>

<p>Once I got one I could never switch back.
My build is centered around their obnoxiously large <a href="https://amzn.to/3pyrIJU" target="_blank">fanned heatsink</a>,
and has been purring for six years.
I expect to reuse the same fans for my next build, whenever it is.</p>

<h2>Jetz Scrubz Sponges</h2>

<p>These kitchen sponges are easily a 10x<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>100x improvement over the traditional sponges,
in all of these categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lifespan before getting damaged</li>
<li>Lifespan before getting permanently gross</li>
<li>Tendancy to get temporarily gross</li>
<li>Ease of cleaning once temporarily gross</li>
</ul>

<p>They're pricier upfront, but cheaper long-term.</p>

<h2>Bidets</h2>

<p>If someone came up to you in the street and smeared poop all over you,
would you wipe it off with a paper towel, or would you take a shower?</p>

<p>Before I tried one, I had three fundamental misunderstandings about bidets:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bidets are separate from toilets.</li>
<li>Bidets are expensive.</li>
<li>It's a big deal to install a bidet.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>None of these is true.</strong>
It takes about 15 minutes to install a bidet onto your toilet,
and you can get one for <a href="https://amzn.to/3McRz2a" target="_blank">under fifty bucks</a>.
It's just a piece of plastic that goes between the toilet and the seat.
You do not need to put your hands inside the toilet bowl to install it.</p>

<p>Bidets pay for themselves in unused toilet paper.
I use between 1<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>10% of the toilet paper I used before.
Its only function now is drying.</p>

<p>Bidets feel weird for about 10 seconds, then never again.
It's honestly disgusting <em>not</em> to use one now.</p>

<p>Buy whichever one makes you try it, but here are some options:</p>

<ul>
<li>($) <a href="https://amzn.to/3McRz2a" target="_blank">Attachment</a>:
Simple, replaces nothing about your toilet, sprays cold water only.
I promise it doesn't feel like a cold shower.
That area of your body doesn't experience temperature the same.</li>
<li>($$) <a href="https://amzn.to/3PYqFwc" target="_blank">Seat</a>:
The weight distribution of my seat got worse with just an attachment,
so a combination seat/bidet is something to consider if that bugs you.
Otherwise, the functions are ~the same as the attachment.</li>
<li>($$$) <a href="https://amzn.to/3S9PBn9" target="_blank">Air Dry</a>;
Seats that plug in jump in price and feature set drastically,
but I think air dry is the only big one to consider.
Warm water is overrated.
If you're not sure if you need a heated seat, you don't.</li>
</ul>

<h1>In Search Of</h1>

<p>I'm in search of a life-changing product for these categories. Please <a href="mailto:ben@twos.dev">email
me</a> if you have recommendations.</p>

<h2>Water Bottle</h2>

<p>I am in search of a reusable water bottle with the following qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can last 10+ years</li>
<li>Can last a week of no washing without getting funky</li>
<li>Is less than ~9cm in diameter (i.e. a comfortable size for a Peak Design Everyday
Backpack V1 20L cup holder)</li>
<li>Holds about 1L</li>
<li>Attached or attachable lid</li>
<li>Ability to stay cold ~1 day preferred</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest I ever came was the <a href="https://amzn.to/42XJaoR" target="_blank">Thermos Element 5 32 oz</a>, but
I lost mine and the product has since discontinued.</p>

<h2>Hair Trimmer</h2>

<p>I am in search of a combination beard and head trimmer with these qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can last 3+ years</li>
<li>USB-C chargeable</li>
<li>Has two or fewer attachments, or a good organization system for attachments</li>
<li>Can trim beards in the 1~6mm range</li>
<li>Can trim head hair in the 1~3cm range</li>
<li>Requires no more than two passes for reasonable coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest I've found in my research is the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3rFxMBB" target="_blank">MANSCAPED Beard Hedger</a>,
but it seems to need five or more passes for good coverage.</p>

Optionally shake and/or serve with ice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://links.mixelcocktails.com/Fjf3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Add recipe to Mixel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The skyhopper is based on the grasshopper, which is traditionally 1:1:1 heavy&#xA;cream : crème de menthe : crème de cacao. We don&#39;t usually have heavy cream&#xA;around so we tend to substitute milk or a milk alternative and fill the glass,&#xA;yielding something like 6:1:1 milk : crème de menthe : crème de cacao.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer likes everything about the grasshopper except the mint flavor. I like&#xA;making grasshoppers because their ingredients are shelf stable and/or always on&#xA;hand (after the milk substitution). I started on a journey to replace the mint&#xA;with orange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Mint to Orange&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mint is a foundational flavor in the grasshopper, so simply replacing it with a&#xA;comparatively light flavor like blue curaçao causes the crème de cacao to fill&#xA;the flavor vacuum, turning it into a chocolatey drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Replacing the crème de cacao with white chocolate liqueur limits the chocolate&#xA;flavor&#39;s impact. The orange bitters then strengthen the orange more. The simple&#xA;syrup removes some flatness from the flavor when not using heavy cream (and can&#xA;probably be dropped otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

<p><em>A grasshopper-adjacent cocktail.</em></p>

<h2>Recipe</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 part blue curaçao</li>
<li>1 part white chocolate liqueur</li>
<li>1 part simple syrup</li>
<li>3 parts milk or milk substitute or 1 part heavy cream</li>
<li>2 dashes orange bitters</li>
</ul>

<p>Combine all ingredients. Optionally shake and/or serve with ice.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The skyhopper is based on the grasshopper, which is traditionally 1:1:1 heavy
cream : crème de menthe : crème de cacao. We don't usually have heavy cream
around so we tend to substitute milk or a milk alternative and fill the glass,
yielding something like 6:1:1 milk : crème de menthe : crème de cacao.</p>

<p>Summer likes everything about the grasshopper except the mint flavor. I like
making grasshoppers because their ingredients are shelf stable and/or always on
hand (after the milk substitution). I started on a journey to replace the mint
with orange.</p>

<h2>Mint to Orange</h2>

<p>Mint is a foundational flavor in the grasshopper, so simply replacing it with a
comparatively light flavor like blue curaçao causes the crème de cacao to fill
the flavor vacuum, turning it into a chocolatey drink.</p>

<p>Replacing the crème de cacao with white chocolate liqueur limits the chocolate
flavor's impact. The orange bitters then strengthen the orange more. The simple
syrup removes some flatness from the flavor when not using heavy cream (and can
probably be dropped otherwise).</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body>

<p>Companies don't make evil decisions.
Companies don't make decisions.
Companies cannot make decisions because companies are lifeless automata which react to stimuli.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>In any population of companies,
some companies will make parts offshore and some will not.</p>

<p>Maybe each company's reasons are rational,
or maybe not,
it doesn't matter.
Maybe someone's cousin knew someone who knew someone.
Maybe someone had a spreadsheet.
Maybe someone went to an inspiring talk.
It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Zoom out.</p>

<p>Some companies will make parts offshore and some won't.
Those companies compete with each other.
One sells a product for <code>$5</code>, the other <code>$9</code>.</p>

<p>The company who sells for <code>$9</code> can't get any sales.
They go out of business.
Now, the only companies left are the ones that already decided to make their products offshore.</p>

<p>Or maybe the <code>$9</code> one is such better quality that consumers spend the extra money,
and the <code>$5</code> one goes out of business.</p>

<p>A citizen cannot complain that these companies are greedy
or unpatriotic
or don't care about quality
and should be punished,
because companies are lifeless automata.
Punishment doesn't exist for lifeless automata.
You can't punish a virus, or a bacterium.
Well you can, but it won't help.</p>

<p>But you can edit the system so the virii, or bacteria, or companies
you <em>want</em> to survive survive.
You can tax things, or subsidize things, or require disclosure of things.
You can say,
"if you want to import a thing, the thing must have been made humanely, even if offshore".
Or,
"if you want to import a thing, you must pay X% tax which will be used to improve lives",
or some such.</p>

<p>You can say,
"if you want to take carbon or methane or nitrous oxide or hydrofluorocarbons out of the ground and put them into the sky,
you have to pay 200% of the downstream cost to remove it".</p>

<p>Or,
"if you want to take carbon or methane or nitrous oxide or hydrofluorocarbons out of the ground and put them into the sky,
you need to buy the rights for the quantity you want to emit,
and the rights are sold on the free market in a limited supply".</p>

<p>We don't need to name any companies.
We don't need to call for the firing of any CEOs.
We don't need to complain that they are not humane.
The companies are automata.
We need to fix the system to align the improvement of lives with companies' survival of market forces.</p>

<h2>The Internet</h2>

<p>This applies to the internet too.
Why do YouTube thumbnails have clickbait titles?
Because the channels that made clickbait titles,
outcompeted the ones that didn't.</p>

<p>Why do recipe sites have 40 pages of nonsense before getting to the recipe?
Because the sites that do that,
had better SEO the ones that didn't,
and so the ones that didn't couldn't afford to pay people to keep publishing new recipes.</p>

<p>Why do some news websites have more area on the page dedicated to ads than not?
Because the ones that did that made more money than the ones that didn't,
and invested that money into growing bigger,
making more stories,
and doing better SEO.</p>

<p><strong>These are automata reacting to stimuli.</strong>
It is useless to imagine an evil genius at the helm of these companies rubbing their hands together on a pile of money.
It doesn't matter if that is what they are doing,
it matters that our market,
as we have built it, apply a sort of evolution that only leaves these companies behind.</p>

<p>And don't let anyone tell you that the market just exists as a natural system,
with its own natural rules.
We made the rules and we can change them with policy.</p>

<p>If you have the power to press a button and dismantle every evil company in an instant,
and you pressed it,
there would be some turmoil and then the market would drift back towards this unhealthy equilibrium.</p>

<p>We need to change the equilibrium.</p>

      <title>The Remote Pop-In</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/thepopin.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This page describes a method of dealing with one of the missing features of&#xA;fully remote teams: the pop-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Pop-In&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pop-in, back before open floorplans, is when you physically walk into&#xA;someone&#39;s office to ask them a question or spitball an idea. In an open&#xA;floorplan you can instead swivel your chair or walk to their desk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pop-in is valuable because it&#39;s as informal as email, but as&#xA;high-bandwidth and low-latency as meetings. It&#39;s interruptive to be popped in&#xA;on, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of physically&#xA;going somewhere is high, and the tools available to the target like doors,&#xA;signs, and social cues are numerous and don&#39;t require much thought to&#xA;implement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slack DMs come close to replacing the pop-in, but they reduce the effort too&#xA;much. This leads to more interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot&#xA;higher in number) and even to the replacement of trackers, emails, and wikis&#xA;with DMs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a lot wrong with the pop-in, but like any tool it has its uses. Many&#xA;great products&amp;amp;mdash;companies, even&amp;amp;mdash;have been built on the shoulders of&#xA;the pop-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Remote Pop-In&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s really no remote equivalent to the pop-in. There are products that&#xA;help you &#34;hang out&#34; like Facebook Portal, but nothing that implements the&#xA;pop-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://yourbase.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;YourBase&lt;/a&gt; we decided we needed one. Rather&#xA;than build another tool, we experimented with Discord. I&#39;m happy to say we&#xA;found something that works, and even solves the worst problem of the&#xA;open-office pop-in: the inability to shut your damned door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Setup&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/thepopin-0-dark.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of a Discord server with several voice channels, some empty, some having one person in them.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company Discord server on a workday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our company Discord server, we give everyone one voice channel of their&#xA;own. This is your &#34;office&#34;. When you are online and able to be disturbed, you&#xA;join your office, alone. You stay in there as long as you are &#34;in&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of how Discord works, everyone can see who is in what office at all&#xA;times. But you can only hear conversations for the room you&#39;re in, and you can&#xA;only be in one room at a time. Joining a room plays an obvious audio chime and&#xA;is not something you can do sneakily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When someone wants to pop in, they join your voice channel. The chime plays,&#xA;they say hello, you unmute and turn on video if you like, and have your&#xA;pop-in. And that&#39;s really it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re going to the restroom and will be AFK, you can join the restroom&#xA;channel. You&#39;re in, but away. No one is actually wearing a headset on the&#xA;toilet, it&#39;s just a fun way to feel like a real office.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve even fallen into some typical office behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We&#39;ve started having meetings in people&#39;s offices, just because it&#39;s easier.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We have a &#34;cafeteria&#34; room where you can eat your lunch if you&#39;ve got nothing going on in real life. We also hold lunch-and-learns here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We have a &#34;rooftop&#34; and other common spaces where some people chill, which&#xA;signals that they&#39;re open for a chat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oddest one is that when it&#39;s slow around the office, you can tell. You can&#xA;  almost hear how quiet it is when you&#39;re the first one in or the last one out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pop-in is valuable because it&#39;s informal, high bandwidth, and low latency.&#xA;  Enabling it using Discord has worked very well for us over the last six&#xA;  months, and we didn&#39;t even have to build anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://discordapp.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; for making such a&#xA;  flexible platform. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://yourbase.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;YourBase&lt;/a&gt; for&#xA;  being so open to crazy ideas. (Check us out if your CI is slow.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzOv2jrC1I8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&#34;The Pop-In&#34;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body>

<p>This page describes a method of dealing with one of the missing features of
fully remote teams: the pop-in.</p>

<h2>The Pop-In</h2>

<p>The pop-in, back before open floorplans, is when you physically walk into
someone's office to ask them a question or spitball an idea. In an open
floorplan you can instead swivel your chair or walk to their desk.</p>

<p>The pop-in is valuable because it's as informal as email, but as
high-bandwidth and low-latency as meetings. It's interruptive to be popped in
on, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of physically
going somewhere is high, and the tools available to the target like doors,
signs, and social cues are numerous and don't require much thought to
implement.</p>

<p>Slack DMs come close to replacing the pop-in, but they reduce the effort too
much. This leads to more interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot
higher in number) and even to the replacement of trackers, emails, and wikis
with DMs.</p>

<p>There's a lot wrong with the pop-in, but like any tool it has its uses. Many
great products&amp;mdash;companies, even&amp;mdash;have been built on the shoulders of
the pop-in.</p>

<h2>The Remote Pop-In</h2>

<p>There's really no remote equivalent to the pop-in. There are products that
help you "hang out" like Facebook Portal, but nothing that implements the
pop-in.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://yourbase.io" target="_blank">YourBase</a> we decided we needed one. Rather
than build another tool, we experimented with Discord. I'm happy to say we
found something that works, and even solves the worst problem of the
open-office pop-in: the inability to shut your damned door.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>

<p><img src="/img/thepopin-0-dark.png" alt="A screenshot of a Discord server with several voice channels, some empty, some having one person in them."/></p>

<p>The company Discord server on a workday.</p>

<p>In our company Discord server, we give everyone one voice channel of their
own. This is your "office". When you are online and able to be disturbed, you
join your office, alone. You stay in there as long as you are "in".</p>

<p>Because of how Discord works, everyone can see who is in what office at all
times. But you can only hear conversations for the room you're in, and you can
only be in one room at a time. Joining a room plays an obvious audio chime and
is not something you can do sneakily.</p>

<p>When someone wants to pop in, they join your voice channel. The chime plays,
they say hello, you unmute and turn on video if you like, and have your
pop-in. And that's really it.</p>

<p>If you're going to the restroom and will be AFK, you can join the restroom
channel. You're in, but away. No one is actually wearing a headset on the
toilet, it's just a fun way to feel like a real office.</p>

<p>We've even fallen into some typical office behaviors:</p>

<ul>
<li>We've started having meetings in people's offices, just because it's easier.</li>
<li>We have a "cafeteria" room where you can eat your lunch if you've got nothing going on in real life. We also hold lunch-and-learns here.</li>
<li>We have a "rooftop" and other common spaces where some people chill, which
signals that they're open for a chat.</li>
</ul>

<p>The oddest one is that when it's slow around the office, you can tell. You can
  almost hear how quiet it is when you're the first one in or the last one out.</p>

<p>The pop-in is valuable because it's informal, high bandwidth, and low latency.
  Enabling it using Discord has worked very well for us over the last six
  months, and we didn't even have to build anything.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://discordapp.com" target="_blank">Discord</a> for making such a
  flexible platform. Thanks to <a href="https://yourbase.io" target="_blank">YourBase</a> for
  being so open to crazy ideas. (Check us out if your CI is slow.)</p>

      <title>Tattoos as Moral Contracts</title>

  This year, I got a tattoo. My morals had been at odds with my behaviors in a
  place very important to me<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>the climate crisis. It’s easy to think about how
  horrible the climate crisis is, and yes definitely someone should do something
  about it, yes probably those big corporations that sounds nice, now let’s
  forget about it for another year.
</p>
<p>
  This isn’t a great way to get things done and I had the cognizance to
  recognize that, but it kept happening to me. So I tattooed a reminder on my
  forearm.

<p>After six months with this puppy, it’s done more than I thought it could.</p>
<p>
  First, it’s a constant reminder. It’s not a checklist item I can mark off or
  that can fall to the bottom of my list. It can’t be forgotten about or left
  behind in an app change. It will be there as long as I will be, which is
  exactly how long I want to be conscious of the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>
  Second, it’s a social forcing function to act within my morals. When people
  ask me about my tattoo, I know I need to “have my story straight”. I need to
  know everything about myself that’s not better than climate par and have a
  roadmap for fixing it ready. No one expects me to be Captain Planet, but if I
  have a methane stove and don’t at least have a plan for going induction, well,
  that’s an embarrassing moment for someone with a climate crisis tattoo.
</p>
<p>
  In just six months these two pressures together have motivated me into
  research, action, and activism on how to make my kids and grandkids not spite
  me. I’m better informed about policy, I'm involved in local Seattle politics
  (actively pushing for more walk-friendly neighborhoods), and our house is
  running on 100% green energy. [2]

<p>
  If you have a lifelong motivation, a few hundred dollars, and a decent
  tolerance for pain, I recommend getting an aspirational tattoo.
