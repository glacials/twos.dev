      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>Obsidian Plugins</h1>

<p>I run many Obsidian plugins and they're constantly changing, but below are the ones that
have stuck around.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jenningsb2/copy-as-html">Copy as HTML</a>

<ul>
<li>I treat this as “copy with formatting” so I can copy e.g. bulleted lists from my notes and paste them into an email to send to others; without it, the copied text is unparsed markdown</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian">Editor Syntax Highlight</a>

<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks, just like GitHub</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin">Excalidraw</a>

<ul>
<li>Unbelievably well-integrated Excalidraw support; embed drawings in notes but also let specific elements in drawings link to notes or dynamically inherit content from notes, and a lot more</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MahmoudFawzyKhalil/obsidian-global-search-and-replace">Global Search and Replace</a>

<ul>
<li>Does what it says on the tin; I expect this will become a first-party feature soon</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter">Linter</a>

<ul>
<li>Automatically apply Markdown linting on save</li>
<li>Cleans up inconsistencies like # line breaks between paragraphs, heading capitalization, re-index ordered lists, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gtg922r/obsidian-numerals">Numerals</a>

<ul>
<li>Adds a code block type for math, including calculating and rendering answers for each line</li>
<li>Basically Jupyter Notebooks for math; easy to show work and avoid mistakes since the answers are calculated on render</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare">QuickShare</a>

<ul>
<li>Publish a note to an auto-expiring shareable URL</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kemayo/obsidian-smart-links">Smart Links</a>

<ul>
<li>Allows specifying patterns to automatically link</li>
<li>I use it so I can write e.g. OPSFLOW-123 to link to a Jira ticket</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I use the <strong>Daily notes</strong> core plugin, which adds a button/command to create a note for today with a predesignated place and title (e.g. <code>Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md</code>). These community plugins extend that:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iiz00/obsidian-daily-note-outline">Daily Note Outline</a>

<ul>
<li>A single pane that shows an outline of <em>all</em> daily notes in reverse chronological order</li>
<li>I have this persistently in my right sidebar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-daily-notes-opener">Daily Notes Opener</a>

<ul>
<li>Auto open today’s note when opening Obsidian</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/larslockefeer/obsidian-plugin-todo">Obsidian TODO</a>

<ul>
<li>Collects TODOs from all notes (daily or not) and shows them in one pane</li>
<li>This is also persistently in my right sidebar</li>
<li>These are markdown todos, which Obsidian natively supports (e.g. <code>- [ ] Go shopping</code>); for a more powerful experience look at <a href="https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks">Tasks</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian">Natural Language Dates</a>

<ul>
<li>Type e.g. <code>@yesterday</code> or <code>@tomorrow</code> to link to the daily note for those days</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/review-obsidian">Review</a>

<ul>
<li>Mark the current spot (any note, any header) as needing review at whatever date you want (e.g. tomorrow); it will be added to that day's daily note</li>
<li>For a different workflow see <a href="https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder">Reminder</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

      <title>Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/recs.html.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a small number of products or behaviors in my life that, in little ways, are&#xA;life-changing. These are them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;5.11 Belt&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wear a belt every day. I used to replace them every 1&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;2 years, then I got &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3ptyErI&#34;&gt;this&#xA;belt&lt;/a&gt;. That was 10 years ago. I have worn it &amp;gt; 95% of days&#xA;since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear. I expect I will never buy another belt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3ptyErI&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; /&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.511tactical.com/tdu-belt-15-plastic-buckle.html&#34;&gt;5.11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Micro Four Thirds&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Micro Four Thirds is a camera + lens conector and system (like Canon EF or Fujifilm X).&#xA;It&#39;s an open standard with many companies participating, although the de facto flagships&#xA;are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its biggest advantage is its high &lt;code&gt;photo quality : bag space required&lt;/code&gt; ratio. My general&#xA;photography archenemy is not having my camera with me; every time I have to settle for&#xA;my phone camera I question the point of continuing my photography hobby at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can bring roughly 2x the gear per bag volume. Or put&#xA;another way, I can travel with half the bag volume. For me this means a larger setup&#xA;fits in a 20L backpack, a camera + couple lenses fits in a 6L sling, and a camera + lens&#xA;squeezes into a 2L chest pouch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III (&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3PtUO81&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii&#34;&gt;OM&#xA;System&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Any Giant Mountable Power Strip&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mounting one of these on the bottom of every desk in the house, paired with &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa&#34;&gt;any&#xA;cheap&lt;/a&gt; cable basket, was the easiest form of cable management&#xA;I&#39;ve ever leveraged. Using a skinny frame and allowing for ~double the number of outlets&#xA;you actually need means every cable can plug in &lt;em&gt;where it is&lt;/em&gt;, instead of routing all&#xA;cables to a central rat&#39;s nest whose residents constantly play musical chairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/44e4c3W&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; /&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kungfukingsocket.com/products/power-strip-6&#34;&gt;KungFuKingSocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Noctua Fans&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&#34;autism.html&#34;&gt;noise-sensitive&lt;/a&gt; person whose major hobbies are mostly in front of&#xA;computers, silence is important to me in a gaming machine.

That build in that exact state has been purring for six years now. I&#xA;haven&#39;t even opened it up for cleaning in three. I expect to reuse the same fans for my&#xA;next build, whenever it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3pyrIJU&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Jetz Scrubz Sponges&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These lil buddies are easily a 10x&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;100x improvement over your traditional yellow and&#xA;green sponges in all of these categories: lifespan before being damaged, lifespan before&#xA;being permanently gross, tendancy to get temporarily gross, ease of cleaning once&#xA;temporarily gross.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re pricier, but I&#39;ve found in the long run the life span makes them cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/46nSjKq&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;In Search Of&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m in search of a life-changing product for these categories.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>Recommendations</h1>

<p>There are a small number of products or behaviors in my life that, in little ways, are
life-changing. These are them.</p>

<h2>5.11 Belt</h2>

<p>I wear a belt every day. I used to replace them every 1<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2 years, then I got <a href="https://amzn.to/3ptyErI">this
belt</a>. That was 10 years ago. I have worn it &gt; 95% of days
since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear. I expect I will never buy another belt.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3ptyErI">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://www.511tactical.com/tdu-belt-15-plastic-buckle.html">5.11</a></p>

<h2>Micro Four Thirds</h2>

<p>Micro Four Thirds is a camera + lens conector and system (like Canon EF or Fujifilm X).
It's an open standard with many companies participating, although the de facto flagships
are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.</p>

<p>Its biggest advantage is its high <code>photo quality : bag space required</code> ratio. My general
photography archenemy is not having my camera with me; every time I have to settle for
my phone camera I question the point of continuing my photography hobby at all.</p>

<p>Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can bring roughly 2x the gear per bag volume. Or put
another way, I can travel with half the bag volume. For me this means a larger setup
fits in a 20L backpack, a camera + couple lenses fits in a 6L sling, and a camera + lens
squeezes into a 2L chest pouch.</p>

<p>I'm using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III (<a href="https://amzn.to/3PtUO81">Amazon</a> / <a href="https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii">OM
System</a>)</p>

<h2>Any Giant Mountable Power Strip</h2>

<p>Mounting one of these on the bottom of every desk in the house, paired with <a href="https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa">any
cheap</a> cable basket, was the easiest form of cable management
I've ever leveraged. Using a skinny frame and allowing for ~double the number of outlets
you actually need means every cable can plug in <em>where it is</em>, instead of routing all
cables to a central rat's nest whose residents constantly play musical chairs.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/44e4c3W">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://kungfukingsocket.com/products/power-strip-6">KungFuKingSocket</a></p>

<h2>Noctua Fans</h2>

<p>As a <a href="autism.html">noise-sensitive</a> person whose major hobbies are mostly in front of
computers, silence is important to me in a gaming machine. Noctua makes giant, silent,
brown fans. That's it.</p>

<p>Once I got one I could never switch back. My next build was centered around the giant
fan-based heatsink. That build in that exact state has been purring for six years now. I
haven't even opened it up for cleaning in three. I expect to reuse the same fans for my
next build, whenever it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3pyrIJU">Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Jetz Scrubz Sponges</h2>

<p>These lil buddies are easily a 10x<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>100x improvement over your traditional yellow and
green sponges in all of these categories: lifespan before being damaged, lifespan before
being permanently gross, tendancy to get temporarily gross, ease of cleaning once
temporarily gross.</p>

<p>They're pricier, but I've found in the long run the life span makes them cheaper.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/46nSjKq">Amazon</a></p>

<h1>In Search Of</h1>

<p>I'm in search of a life-changing product for these categories. Please <a href="mailto:ben@twos.dev">email
me</a> if you have recommendations.</p>

<h2>Water Bottle</h2>

<p>I am in search of a reusable water bottle that can last 10+ years with the following
qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can last a week of no washing without getting funky</li>
<li>Is less than ~9cm in diameter (i.e. a comfortable size for a Peak Design Everyday
Backpack V1 20L cup holder)</li>
<li>Holds about 1L</li>
<li>Unlosable lid (i.e. attached to body, even when off)</li>
<li>Ability to stay cold ~1 day preferred</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest I ever came was the <a href="https://amzn.to/42XJaoR">Thermos Element 5 32 oz</a>, but
I lost mine and the product has since discontinued.</p>

      <title>90 &gt; 100</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/90.html.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;90 &amp;gt; 100&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do more things at 90% effort. If you believe you can only choose 0% or 100%, you’ll&#xA;often choose 0% because you cannot afford 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I became very engaged in helping with the climate emergency in the last couple of years. One big line item on the list of emitters is meat. A 100g serving of beef emits the equivalent of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.co2everything.com/co2e-of/beef&#34;&gt;15kg&lt;/a&gt; of CO₂ into the atmosphere, the same as driving 78km (48mi). A 100g serving of tofu emits 0.08 kg of CO₂ equivalent.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:CO-equivalent-CO&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:CO-equivalent-CO&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, a week of eating beef emits more CO₂e than three years of eating tofu.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3x-meals-daily-o&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3x-meals-daily-o&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For someone wanting to reduce emissions, vegetarianism is a clear candidate. But there are some things about being vegetarian I can&#39;t do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Summer is deeply carnivorous and I don&#39;t want to put her through the effects of my choice (we did try).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&#39;t want to be that person in the friend group people have to plan around, the person whose presence at a barbecue makes an unprepared host feel guilty.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are formats of meat I get occasional cravings for, like a burger or a ball park hot dog.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t be 100% vegetarian. But that&#39;s no reason to stay at 0%.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>90 &gt; 100</h1>

<p>Do more things at 90% effort. If you believe you can only choose 0% or 100%, you’ll
often choose 0% because you cannot afford 100%.</p>

<p>I became very engaged in helping with the climate emergency in the last couple of years. One big line item on the list of emitters is meat. A 100g serving of beef emits the equivalent of <a href="https://www.co2everything.com/co2e-of/beef">15kg</a> of CO₂ into the atmosphere, the same as driving 78km (48mi). A 100g serving of tofu emits 0.08 kg of CO₂ equivalent.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:CO-equivalent-CO"><a href="#fn:CO-equivalent-CO">1</a></sup> In other words, a week of eating beef emits more CO₂e than three years of eating tofu.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3x-meals-daily-o"><a href="#fn:3x-meals-daily-o">2</a></sup></p>

<p>For someone wanting to reduce emissions, vegetarianism is a clear candidate. But there are some things about being vegetarian I can't do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Summer is deeply carnivorous and I don't want to put her through the effects of my choice (we did try).</li>
<li>I don't want to be that person in the friend group people have to plan around, the person whose presence at a barbecue makes an unprepared host feel guilty.</li>
<li>There are formats of meat I get occasional cravings for, like a burger or a ball park hot dog.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can't be 100% vegetarian. But that's no reason to stay at 0%. I can cut meat from the ~90% of meals that don't cause any of these issues.</p>

<p>So I became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexitarianism">flexitarian</a> which for me means "vegetarian except when it would inconvenience people". If 90% of the world could become 90% vegetarian the benefit would be nearly that of 100%/100% but orders of magnitude easier to achieve.</p>

<p>We need to adopt this strategy more. It's similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/80-20_rule">80/20 rule</a>, but 80/20 optimizes bang-for-buck when building things. 90 &gt; 100 is about recognizing that <code>impact per success</code> is a worse thing to optimize for than <code>success rate * impact per success</code>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>Form is Function</h1>

<p>We are not rational creatures. We have irrational fears, hates, beliefs, biases. There are entire fields of study on these irrationalities. Those fields are still discovering new ways our brains fail us.</p>

<p>When we pit form against function, we ignore this. We put function in the light of getting things done, and form in the light of looking pretty for... reasons?</p>

<p>Form<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>design<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>does a lot. For the sake of argument, let's boil it down to its essence: it makes products enjoyable.</p>

<p>Enjoyability has utility.</p>

<h2>Anticlutter</h2>

<p>When I'm in a messy space, it gets in my head. I become anxious and distracted, but not enough to realize it. I don't know there's a problem to be fixed.</p>

<p>When I happen to fix it by tidying my space, I sit down in my chair and feel peace and productivity wash over me. In this space and headspace the creative possibilities lay themselves in front of me. The doodads are in their places, the surfaces are ready to be used. I am calm. I am concentrated, ready to take on a challenge.</p>

<p>This makes no sense I can gather. Maybe at some evolutionary stage it paid to have a clean space, or maybe it's a byproduct of some other evolutionary development. Today it really shouldn't matter if I have a couple of things scattered about.</p>

<p>But it does. We must learn "it shouldn't matter" does not mean "it doesn't matter". You don't go to the users who fell out of your funnel and explain why they're being irrational. You fix the funnel.</p>

<p>We need to build our own funnels around our own brains' irrationalities.</p>

<h2>Interior Design</h2>

<p>I took it one step further than clutter started learning to make a space itself invoke this feeling, rather than just the objects that exist inside it. This is how I started my interior design kick.</p>

<p>If you thought sitting down in a newly tidied space was irrationally motivating, wait until you sit down in a well designed space. Even learning the basics of color theory throws an alleged rational mind for a twist. Learn about <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/">the silly irrational rules</a> for good vs. bad color pairings and then notice that actually, the supposed good pairings <em>do</em> look better.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>It has never been form vs. function. Form is a category of function. It is the category focused on the subtleties we don't realize we enjoy. And enjoyment has utility.</p>

<p>I am more productive in a space with good form than in a space with bad form. This applies to more than just physical spaces. After twelve years on Android, switching to iPhone had that unnamed UX feeling of peace and motivation. The design handbook permeates the OS and nearly all popular apps. It's enjoyable to just use the OS.</p>

<p>The biggest prank here is you can't quite express why. I'm not even sure that I have on this page. People criticize Apple users for spending <code>$MONEY</code> on <code>$SPEC_SHEET</code> when they could have spent less on more, and for choosing a locked-down experience over a customizable one. Apple users suck at arguing against this because all the reasons they like Apple products are inherently nonsensical. They're inbuilt traits of us as a species, but not something allowed in rational conversation.</p>

<p>Let us acknowledge that our species has irrationalities and not be ashamed of them. Eating sweet desserts, seeking out sweeping landscapes, engaging in nonproductive sex<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>these are all irrational nonsensical behaviors fueled by evolutionary leftovers, and acknowledging they can be irrational and also real is our only way to continue the conversation around them.</p>

I worked for six months on a team that manages&#xA;the data pipeline between panels and the consumer mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I jumped in February 2023 to a new team spun up to reimagine the&#xA;customer onboarding pipeline that takes place between someone saying&#xA;&#34;I would like some panels please&#34; and actually getting the panels&#xA;bolted to their roof. This is a complex process involving permitting,&#xA;panel placement design, electrical work, and shipping the right parts&#xA;to the right place, among sometimes-exceptional circumstances like&#xA;roof replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The team&#39;s goal is to take this process from the current ~months down&#xA;to ~days. It involves a lot of learning and has been super fun so&#xA;far. I&#39;m working with two people who are also ex-&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitch.tv&#34;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, which has&#xA;been a fun bonding experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After about six months full-steam in Emacs and Org Mode, I grew impatient with the subpar mobile experience for Org and accidentally stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>SunPower</h2>

<p>Since July 2022 I've worked at <a href="https://sunpower.com">SunPower</a>, a consumer solar panel
company serving the US. I worked for six months on a team that manages
the data pipeline between panels and the consumer mobile app.</p>

<p>I jumped in February 2023 to a new team spun up to reimagine the
customer onboarding pipeline that takes place between someone saying
"I would like some panels please" and actually getting the panels
bolted to their roof. This is a complex process involving permitting,
panel placement design, electrical work, and shipping the right parts
to the right place, among sometimes-exceptional circumstances like
roof replacement.</p>

<p>The team's goal is to take this process from the current ~months down
to ~days. It involves a lot of learning and has been super fun so
far. I'm working with two people who are also ex-<a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a>, which has
been a fun bonding experience.</p>

<h2>Obsidian</h2>

<p>After about six months full-steam in Emacs and Org Mode, I grew impatient with the subpar mobile experience for Org and accidentally stumbled upon <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. It honestly has handled 80% of the crazy Org superpowers for 20% of the effort. The plugin ecosystem is fantastic, and synchronization of config, plugins, and themes to all platforms<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>including mobile<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>"just works".</p>

<p>I've moved my notetaking from a mix of Apple Notes and Org completely to Obsidian, and am back on a mix of VS Code and Vim for coding.</p>

<h2>This Website</h2>

<p>Somehow after a dozen attempts over two dozen years I finally have a
website that I've stuck with for a while, twos.dev. The secret sauce
turned out to be building a static site generator myself. I often want to try some new
way of writing (e.g. writing in Org during my Emacs kick) and owning the generator is the only way I can be
sure those cravings don't lead me to switch from this engine to that looking for
the right set of features instead of actually writing.</p>

<p>(For more information see <a href="/meta.html">Inside twos.dev</a>, or the <a href="/winter">documentation</a> for
the generator.)</p>

<h2>Autism</h2>

<p>I found out in 2020 that I'm autistic and it's been a fantastic and
eye-opening experience. Every ~month (at first every ~day) I learn
that some weird behavior about myself is attributable to autism, and
that there's a pool of people I can talk to about it. These vary from
having been mute for 9 years as a child, to spending multiple hours
per day preparing and retrospecting conversations I've had, to not
liking hot weather, to sometimes feeling like every little noise is
far too loud.</p>

<p>I wrote about it in an article titled <a href="/autism.html">Anonymously Autistic</a>.</p>

<h2>Mastodon</h2>

<p>I've mostly jumped ship from Twitter and have switched to Mastodon:
<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@glacials">@glacials@hachyderm.io</a>.</p>

<p>I self-hosted Mastodon and Lemmy instances for a year or so and I don't regret it; I
know a lot more about the fediverse than when I started. But the benefits started to
flatten and the costs were high, so I recently moved to Hachyderm. Their code of ethics
and governance model is impressive.</p>

The simple version of this recipe is 1&#xA;part orange juice to 1 part milk or milk alternative. It sounds disgusting, but&#xA;it&#39;s way too close to perfect for how simple it is.

<h2>Recipe</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 part blue curaçao</li>
<li>1 part white chocolate liqueur</li>
<li>1 part simple syrup</li>
<li>3 parts milk or milk substitute or 1 part heavy cream</li>
<li>2 dashes orange bitters</li>
</ul>

<p>Combine all ingredients. Optionally shake and/or serve with ice.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The skyhopper is based on the grasshopper, which is traditionally 1:1:1 heavy
cream : crème de menthe : crème de cacao. We don't usually have heavy cream
around so we tend to substitute milk or a milk alternative and fill the glass,
yielding something like 6:1:1 milk : crème de menthe : crème de cacao.</p>

<p>Summer likes everything about the grasshopper except the mint flavor. I like
making grasshoppers because their ingredients are shelf stable and/or always on
hand (after the milk substitution). I started on a journey to replace the mint
with orange.</p>

<h2>Mint to Orange</h2>

<p>Mint is a foundational flavor in the grasshopper, so simply replacing it with a
comparatively light flavor like blue curaçao causes the crème de cacao to fill
the flavor vacuum, turning it into a chocolatey drink.</p>

<p>Replacing the crème de cacao with white chocolate liqueur limits the chocolate
flavor's impact. The orange bitters then strengthen the orange more. The simple
syrup removes some flatness from the flavor when not using heavy cream (and can
probably be dropped otherwise).</p>

<p>Synchrony grants speed, but asynchrony grants efficiency. Like debt each has

<p>I've been in a secure war room exactly once in my career, for a week minus sleep
handling a business-threatening emergency.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Before-tech-OSHA"><a href="#fn:Before-tech-OSHA">1</a></sup> In that room we built some of the fastest product

This is... almost true. The confusing correction is that an em dash is so named because it is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; wide. Incidentally, the en is defined as half of one em; much of my focus will be on the em.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Em&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To talk about the em dash necessitates talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)&#34;&gt;em&lt;/a&gt;. The em (pronounced &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation&#34;&gt;/ɛm/&lt;/a&gt;) is a unit of length defined as the height of the character bounding box.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:boundingbox&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:boundingbox&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This height changes with font family and size, so the length of the em changes with it: &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; is always one &lt;em&gt;font-heighth&lt;/em&gt; long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifying a font size in ems, then, is an exercise in ratios. The CSS declaration &lt;code&gt;font-size: 1em&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;font-size: 100%&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;1.5em&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;150%&lt;/code&gt; and so on; the current font size is used as a base to specify the desired font size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em&#39;s eccentric offering is that it can be used outside the context of font sizes. It can set margins, widths, even blur radii based on the font size of the containing context. It can scale an image up and down with the text around it, whether the text&#39;s changing size is a product of assistive technologies or simply of a component being reused in multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em came about in the times of the printing press, when every &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type was large and perfectly square, thus convenient to use as a proportional measurement for a given font and size. When the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type eventually rebelled against being square, the modern em shifted its definition to the remaining constant, the height. At the time this was effectively a non-change, but the updated definition allowed the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; and the em to be decoupled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;The Em Dash&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the tailwind given by the definition of the em, the em dash is easily defined: a dash that is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; long. In a way, the em dash took up the mantle of the square &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type. Because the em dash is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; long, and the em is defined as the height of the font, the em dash&#39;s bounding box is an exact square&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;in any font, at any size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;The Root Em&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;root em&lt;/strong&gt; is a twist on the em. Where the em is defined using the current context&#39;s font size, the root em is defined using the root context&#39;s font size (in a web page, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). This allows escape from relativity hell without reverting to absolutes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;html: 16pt              (default     = 16pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  → body: 1.5em         (16pt * 1.5  = 24pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    → .container: .75em (24pt *  .75 = 18pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      → h1: 4em         (18pt * 4    = 72pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      → p: 1em          (18pt * 1    = 18pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    → footer: 0.5rem    (16pt * 0.5  =  8pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;key:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;context: requested size (calculation = final size)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  → child element&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Aside: The Point&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to define the em in terms of points without defining the point. The point has had a tumultuous and unstandardized history both physically and digitally, but today the world has predominantly settled on &lt;code&gt;1/72in&lt;/code&gt; per point. This varies greatly among displays, devices, and assistive technologies; for example, a 21” 1440p display has more pixels per inch than a 27” 1440p display. To wrangle the variability, there exist new unstandardized concepts like &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskUseDP&#34;&gt;density-independent pixels&lt;/a&gt; on Android and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design#effective-pixels-and-scale-factor&#34;&gt;effective pixels&lt;/a&gt; on Windows. The tumultuous history, as it happens, hasn&#39;t ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the displays I develop on, I’ve settled on a rough mental framework of “1px of em length per pt” because it’s close enough to true and easy to remember: a 16pt font has a 16px em and is therefore 16px high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advanced usage of dashes unfortunately revolves around avoiding common issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Em Dash Overuse&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em dash tends to be a trap to a new writer. It is sympathetic to stream-of-consciousness writing, wherein the writer is in &#34;append-only&#34; mode&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;thinking not of the structure of the sentence but of what new words may clarify it when tacked on. For people whose writings spring from internal monologues this seems a neat way to avoid adding structure to organic thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organic thoughts have their place in writing, but it turns out spending time perfecting sentence structure pays dividends to the reader. Long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. Because the pre-dash thought may continue post-dash, the reader must keep its grammar and intention in an internal buffer, which&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;can be hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the em dash is a large glyph and hard to go unnoticed. Its use is obvious even in peripheral vision, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page before reading it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Belittled Hyphens&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like &#34;frozen yogurt&#34; its spaces can visually overpower the hyphen: &lt;code&gt;pre-frozen yogurt&lt;/code&gt; looks like &lt;code&gt;[pre-frozen] yogurt&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;pre-[frozen yogurt]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One solution replaces spaces with hyphens (&lt;code&gt;pre-frozen-yogurt&lt;/code&gt;), which may or may not suit the hyphenation. The opposite (&lt;code&gt;pre frozen yogurt&lt;/code&gt;) is another tool in the bag, but the best it can do is shift ambiguity, not remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\LaTeX\)&lt;/span&gt; users can replace each space with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\thinspace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to de-emphasize them relative to hyphens, though the difference is subtle enough that you may also consider elongating nearby spaces:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a pre-frozen&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\thinspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;yogurt time&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\enspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;pre-frozen&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\thinspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;yogurt&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\enspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;time&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\text{a pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt time}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\text{a\enspace{}pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt\enspace{}time}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, the most common tool I reach for is to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a time before frozen yogurt&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s crude, but dependable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Broken Dashes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It&#39;s accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being introduced to join a word split across lines. En and em dashes are a little harder to parse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;↓ left page edge             ↓ right page edge&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;I am looking at dates about 20&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;30 days out.&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;

Because &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\LaTeX\)&lt;/span&gt; reserves two hyphens for the en dash, it requires three (&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;) for the em.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Output Difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When rendering monospaced fonts, the glyphs for many dashes are virtually&#xA;indistinguishable from each other.

<p>There are three common dashes in written English:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyphen : <span style="“font-family:sans-serif”">-</span></li>
<li>En dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span></li>
<li>Em dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The hyphen is used to join words, prefixes, and/or suffixes together, like father-in-law.</p>

<p>The en dash is used to create ranges, like 2020<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2030.</p>

<p>The em dash can be used as a more powerful parenthetical, a replacement for a colon, or to represent an interruption of a speaker.</p>

<h2>One Size Doesn't Fit All</h2>

<p>A myth states the em dash is so named because it is "one <code>M</code> wide", and the en dash "one <code>N</code> wide". This is... almost true. The confusing correction is that an em dash is so named because it is <code>1em</code> wide. Incidentally, the en is defined as half of one em; much of my focus will be on the em.</p>

<h3>The Em</h3>

<p>To talk about the em dash necessitates talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)">em</a>. The em (pronounced <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation">/ɛm/</a>) is a unit of length defined as the height of the character bounding box.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:boundingbox"><a href="#fn:boundingbox">1</a></sup> This height changes with font family and size, so the length of the em changes with it: <code>1em</code> is always one <em>font-heighth</em> long.</p>

<p>Specifying a font size in ems, then, is an exercise in ratios. The CSS declaration <code>font-size: 1em</code> is equivalent to <code>font-size: 100%</code>, while <code>1.5em</code> is equivalent to <code>150%</code> and so on; the current font size is used as a base to specify the desired font size.</p>

<p>The em's eccentric offering is that it can be used outside the context of font sizes. It can set margins, widths, even blur radii based on the font size of the containing context. It can scale an image up and down with the text around it, whether the text's changing size is a product of assistive technologies or simply of a component being reused in multiple contexts.</p>

<p>The em came about in the times of the printing press, when every <code>M</code> type was large and perfectly square, thus convenient to use as a proportional measurement for a given font and size. When the <code>M</code> type eventually rebelled against being square, the modern em shifted its definition to the remaining constant, the height. At the time this was effectively a non-change, but the updated definition allowed the <code>M</code> and the em to be decoupled.</p>

<h4>The Em Dash</h4>

<p>With the tailwind given by the definition of the em, the em dash is easily defined: a dash that is <code>1em</code> long. In a way, the em dash took up the mantle of the square <code>M</code> type. Because the em dash is <code>1em</code> long, and the em is defined as the height of the font, the em dash's bounding box is an exact square<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>in any font, at any size.</p>

<h4>The Root Em</h4>

<p>The <code>rem</code> or <strong>root em</strong> is a twist on the em. Where the em is defined using the current context's font size, the root em is defined using the root context's font size (in a web page, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>). This allows escape from relativity hell without reverting to absolutes:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="cl">html: 16pt              (default     = 16pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 2</span><span class="cl">  → body: 1.5em         (16pt * 1.5  = 24pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 3</span><span class="cl">    → .container: .75em (24pt *  .75 = 18pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 4</span><span class="cl">      → h1: 4em         (18pt * 4    = 72pt)

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 6</span><span class="cl">    → footer: 0.5rem    (16pt * 0.5  =  8pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 7</span><span class="cl">

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">10</span><span class="cl">  → child element
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<h4>Aside: The Point</h4>

<p>It’s hard to define the em in terms of points without defining the point. The point has had a tumultuous and unstandardized history both physically and digitally, but today the world has predominantly settled on <code>1/72in</code> per point. This varies greatly among displays, devices, and assistive technologies; for example, a 21” 1440p display has more pixels per inch than a 27” 1440p display. To wrangle the variability, there exist new unstandardized concepts like <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskUseDP">density-independent pixels</a> on Android and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design#effective-pixels-and-scale-factor">effective pixels</a> on Windows. The tumultuous history, as it happens, hasn't ended.</p>

<p>Based on the displays I develop on, I’ve settled on a rough mental framework of “1px of em length per pt” because it’s close enough to true and easy to remember: a 16pt font has a 16px em and is therefore 16px high.</p>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<p>Advanced usage of dashes unfortunately revolves around avoiding common issues.</p>

<h3>Em Dash Overuse</h3>

<p>The em dash tends to be a trap to a new writer. It is sympathetic to stream-of-consciousness writing, wherein the writer is in "append-only" mode<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>thinking not of the structure of the sentence but of what new words may clarify it when tacked on. For people whose writings spring from internal monologues this seems a neat way to avoid adding structure to organic thoughts.</p>

<p>Organic thoughts have their place in writing, but it turns out spending time perfecting sentence structure pays dividends to the reader. Long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. Because the pre-dash thought may continue post-dash, the reader must keep its grammar and intention in an internal buffer, which<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>can be hard to do.</p>

<p>Separately, the em dash is a large glyph and hard to go unnoticed. Its use is obvious even in peripheral vision, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page before reading it.</p>

<h3>Belittled Hyphens</h3>

<p>When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like "frozen yogurt" its spaces can visually overpower the hyphen: <code>pre-frozen yogurt</code> looks like <code>[pre-frozen] yogurt</code>, not <code>pre-[frozen yogurt]</code>.</p>

<p>One solution replaces spaces with hyphens (<code>pre-frozen-yogurt</code>), which may or may not suit the hyphenation. The opposite (<code>pre frozen yogurt</code>) is another tool in the bag, but the best it can do is shift ambiguity, not remove it.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> users can replace each space with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space"><code>\thinspace</code></a> to de-emphasize them relative to hyphens, though the difference is subtle enough that you may also consider elongating nearby spaces:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt time
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">a<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>time
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{a pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt time}\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[\text{a\enspace{}pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt\enspace{}time}\]</span></p><p>Personally, the most common tool I reach for is to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a time before frozen yogurt
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>It's crude, but dependable.</p>

<h3>Broken Dashes</h3>

<p>If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It's accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being introduced to join a word split across lines. En and em dashes are a little harder to parse.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓ left page edge             ↓ right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am looking at dates about 20
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>30 days out.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm looking at dates about 20<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">30 days out.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am pleased they thought that
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>however odd it may be.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm pleased they thought that<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">however odd it may be.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>Strangely, the hyphen is the only dash that has an option here: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Non-breaking_hyphens">non-breaking hyphen</a> or "hard hyphen" is a hyphen glyph that sends a signal to the word wrapper that a wrap must not happen after it.</p>

<h3>Drowned Dashes</h3>

<p>When using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified">justified text</a> elongated spaces can overpower dashes where non-elongated spaces would not have.</p>

<p>For example, see this simulation of left-aligned text:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓ left page edge             ↓ right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I said they were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">playdates don't last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>And this simulation of justified text:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I    said    they   were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">playdates don't last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>In the justified simulation, "were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf" may read like the mythical creature "were-wolf" because the em dash looks short relative to the longer spaces.</p>

<p>A solution surrounds each parenthetical em dash with a space on either side, causing its total width to scale up at twice the rate of spaces:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">↓                            ↓
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I   said  they  were  <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>  wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">playdates don't last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<h3>Input Difficulties</h3>

<p>Standard US keyboards support only the hyphen, so many en and em dash users simply compose them from hyphens and spaces.</p>

<p>No one should ever fault that, but for those who are willing to commit something new to memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>macOS

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>⌥ + -</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>⌥ + Shift + -</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>Alt + 0150</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>Alt + 0151</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For all others, read on.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered En Dash</h4>

<p>The en dash looks similar enough to the hyphen in most fonts that people often settle for a single hyphen: <code>2020-2030</code>. <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> requires two (<code>--</code>) for the en dash.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered Em Dash</h4>

<p>A common replacement for the em dash is a space on either end of two hyphens (<code>--</code>). Because <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> reserves two hyphens for the en dash, it requires three (<code>---</code>) for the em.</p>

<h3>Output Difficulties</h3>

<p>When rendering monospaced fonts, the glyphs for many dashes are virtually
indistinguishable from each other. To make the differences visible, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/a61379f9c0f121e9e98033c2a32c3ef47f975f48/winter/document.go#L41-L47">a bespoke
preprocessing
step</a>
to render twos.dev's dashes in a variable width font, even when among monospaced
characters.</p>

<p>I'd love for there to be a "monospace with exceptions" font that takes this chore out of my hands.</p>

<h2>Bonus Round: Esoteric Dashes</h2>

<p>The hyphen, en dash, and em dash get all the love, but behind the scenes are a silent majority of dashes that don't often get to see the light of day.</p>

<p>The <strong>swung dash</strong> (<span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>) is an elongated tilde used to stand in for a word being defined in a dictionary.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:swung"><a href="#fn:swung">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>boot (n)</p>

<p>ex: Let me put on my other <span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>horizontal bar</strong> is a way to introduce quotations. Confusingly, its length is almost always identical to the em dash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">―</span> O Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!</p>

<p><em>James Joyce's Ulysses p. 335</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>hyphen bullet</strong> is a hyphen to be used in place of a bullet point.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">- This is a hyphen
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁃</span> This is a hyphen bullet
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>The <strong>figure dash</strong> is a variant of the en dash having the same width as digits (which are uniformly wide in most fonts). It is meant for phone numbers and other numeric contexts where columnar alignment is required or pleasing.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">Figure dash: 867‒5309
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">Number:      86705309
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">En dash:     867<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>5309
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">Hyphen:      867-5309
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>Lastly, my favorite: the <strong>soft hyphen</strong> is a zero-width, invisible character that (opposite to the hard hyphen) denotes a place the word wrapper is <em>welcome</em> to wrap. This can be used in the middle of a compound word or long line of inert code to provide a cleaner wrap.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge            v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                           |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">No soft hyphen:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilisticexpialid-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">5</span><span class="cl">ocious
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">6</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">7</span><span class="cl">Soft hyphen after 'istic':
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">8</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilistic-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">9</span><span class="cl">expialidocious
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

      <title>Inside twos.dev</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/meta.html.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Inside twos.dev&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a unique advantage in working on twos.dev over anything I’ve worked on: it has just one developer, me. I can therefore design the developer experience in obnoxious and unintuitive ways to serve my peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I decided to ruthlessly optimize for two goals:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must be easy to publish writing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As long as I&#39;m alive, URLs must not change&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some ways these goals work against each other; easy creation usually means easy destruction. So I divide my content into two types, warm and cold. Warm content is easy to create and edit, while cold content is hard to break.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Warm Content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to write drafts in my notes app then migrate to HTML when the piece became less amorphous; from then on I would write and edit directly in HTML. This was surprisingly refreshing as it allowed me to have wild one-off customizations for individual posts, but it had three problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Writing HTML is a rough context switch (what was scribbling drafts on my phone became sitting at my computer in &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Writing was slowed down by cruft like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reading experience can flow differently on a web page than in a notes app, leading to large rewrites after transferring&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To solve these issues and work towards my first goal, I needed tooling in the space between amorphous notes and strict HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first focused on changing my drafting app to something with more robust exporting tools. I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://ia.net/writer&#34;&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt;, which has been great to get my thoughts out quickly. It looks nice and has tools for reducing filler words and cliches. Importantly, it stores writing as Markdown files in an online drive of my choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;iOS and macOS ship with &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752&#34;&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, a no-code event-driven automation app. Using Shortcuts, I set up an automation that triggers when I switch away from the iA Writer app. The automation adds a 1-2 line YAML frontmatter section to each document, then pushes it to the &lt;code&gt;src/warm&lt;/code&gt; directory in the twos.dev Git repository by invoking &lt;a href=&#34;https://workingcopyapp.com&#34;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On push, GitHub Actions builds the Markdown file into HTML with all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/c59cc1a/winter/document.go#L408-L436&#34;&gt;right preprocessing&lt;/a&gt; required to make it look like twos.dev. I use a small subset of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.go.dev/html/template&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;html/template&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow myself to put things like MP4 screen recordings and dark-mode-aware images into Markdown. This is also where the frontmatter from before is stripped and parsed into metadata inserted elsewhere on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically at this point the page is now published, just not linked to from anywhere. I can see how it looks in the context of twos.dev, and send the link to friends who have offered to review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cold Content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 2-3 needs warm content doesn&#39;t cover: first, this odd pipeline that uses my phone for CI is not something I have high confidence in, so I&#39;d like to limit its blast radius to content that benefits from it&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;content I&#39;m actively working on&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;and keep safe the innocent bystanders that are historical content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, once in a while I need some wacky one-off piece of code for a single post, like the CSS-only spectrum in &lt;a href=&#34;autism.html&#34;&gt;Anonymously Autistic&lt;/a&gt; or the variable-width font requirements of &lt;a href=&#34;dashes.html&#34;&gt;Advanced Dashes&lt;/a&gt;. iA Writer is great for prose, but when it&#39;s time to write code I need to be back in &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cold content exists to serve these needs. At the most basic level, cold content is just warm content that has been moved to a directory outside the reach of the warm pipeline. This is content I only touch with &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;, like a normal code repository.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fully turn warm content cold, there is a small amount of bookkeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Winter&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To handle this bookkeeping along with the other build pipeline steps, I wrote the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twos.dev/winter&#34;&gt;Winter&lt;/a&gt; CLI. Winter can handle the process of converting warm content to cold like so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;winter freeze DOCUMENT&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which more or less performs a &lt;code&gt;git mv src/{cold,warm}/DOCUMENT.md&lt;/code&gt; plus chips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winter also handles all the static generation. Writing my own generator was an&#xA;important step in building longevity into twos.dev because I often switch tools&#xA;when I discover a small feature I want but don&#39;t have (put simply: &#34;oo shiny&#34;)&#xA;and that switching of tools is what eventually erodes the content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many static site generators are open source, but I&#39;ll often prefer to switch&#xA;tools than learn how to contribute if the barrier to entry contribution is&#xA;high, such as a language I don&#39;t like writing or an overly complex architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing the generator myself guarantees that barrier is minimal. Writing it in&#xA;Go is a guarantee the code will not rot quickly or fall into dependency hell&#xA;after a few years without attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Post-freeze&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After freezing my content I may also take one final step of permanently&#xA;rendering it to HTML if I&#39;ve built more than a little code into it. Sure I can&#xA;always embed HTML in Markdown, but taking this extra step gives me all my editor&#xA;doodads and hardens the file against future changes to preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;winter build&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;mv dist/DOCUMENT.html src/cold/DOCUMENT.html&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git rm src/cold/DOCUMENT.md&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git add src/cold/DOCUMENT.html&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This brings back the weight of editing prose in HTML, but these cases are the minority and at this point most of the writing is done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allowing myself this escape hatch is freeing. I’m more encouraged to write interactive or otherwise bespoke components, and twos.dev becomes consistent by default but in a way I can break when I need (e.g. for a &lt;a href=&#34;cv.html&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s bicolumnar layout).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;On URLs Not Changing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use my website as a test bed for interesting technology. As a side effect, content has been lost over the years as it becomes hard to migrate to overhauled versions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It so happens that by keeping my writing in Markdown or raw HTML/CSS, I make it easy to accomplish my second goal: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI&#34;&gt;cool URLs don’t change&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve removed the possibility that changing frontend or backend frameworks will leave my documents behind; Markdown is not going anywhere, and all the HTML files need to look decent is a header and footer. In the worst case scenario I&#39;ll simply &lt;code&gt;cp -r dist&lt;/code&gt; to my next crazy system&#39;s web root.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I’ve done things right, this web page will be accessible at twos.dev/meta.html for at least as long as I live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>Inside twos.dev</h1>

<p>There's a unique advantage in working on twos.dev over anything I’ve worked on: it has just one developer, me. I can therefore design the developer experience in obnoxious and unintuitive ways to serve my peculiarities.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to ruthlessly optimize for two goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>It must be easy to publish writing</li>
<li>As long as I'm alive, URLs must not change</li>
</ol>

<p>In some ways these goals work against each other; easy creation usually means easy destruction. So I divide my content into two types, warm and cold. Warm content is easy to create and edit, while cold content is hard to break.</p>

<h2>Warm Content</h2>

<p>I used to write drafts in my notes app then migrate to HTML when the piece became less amorphous; from then on I would write and edit directly in HTML. This was surprisingly refreshing as it allowed me to have wild one-off customizations for individual posts, but it had three problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing HTML is a rough context switch (what was scribbling drafts on my phone became sitting at my computer in <code>$EDITOR</code>)</li>
<li>Writing was slowed down by cruft like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code></li>
<li>The reading experience can flow differently on a web page than in a notes app, leading to large rewrites after transferring</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve these issues and work towards my first goal, I needed tooling in the space between amorphous notes and strict HTML.</p>

<p>I first focused on changing my drafting app to something with more robust exporting tools. I found <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, which has been great to get my thoughts out quickly. It looks nice and has tools for reducing filler words and cliches. Importantly, it stores writing as Markdown files in an online drive of my choosing.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>iOS and macOS ship with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752">Shortcuts</a>, a no-code event-driven automation app. Using Shortcuts, I set up an automation that triggers when I switch away from the iA Writer app. The automation adds a 1-2 line YAML frontmatter section to each document, then pushes it to the <code>src/warm</code> directory in the twos.dev Git repository by invoking <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>.</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>

<p>On push, GitHub Actions builds the Markdown file into HTML with all the <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/c59cc1a/winter/document.go#L408-L436">right preprocessing</a> required to make it look like twos.dev. I use a small subset of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/html/template"><code>html/template</code></a> to allow myself to put things like MP4 screen recordings and dark-mode-aware images into Markdown. This is also where the frontmatter from before is stripped and parsed into metadata inserted elsewhere on the page.</p>

<p>Technically at this point the page is now published, just not linked to from anywhere. I can see how it looks in the context of twos.dev, and send the link to friends who have offered to review.</p>

<h2>Cold Content</h2>

<p>There are 2-3 needs warm content doesn't cover: first, this odd pipeline that uses my phone for CI is not something I have high confidence in, so I'd like to limit its blast radius to content that benefits from it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>content I'm actively working on<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and keep safe the innocent bystanders that are historical content.</p>

<p>Second, once in a while I need some wacky one-off piece of code for a single post, like the CSS-only spectrum in <a href="autism.html">Anonymously Autistic</a> or the variable-width font requirements of <a href="dashes.html">Advanced Dashes</a>. iA Writer is great for prose, but when it's time to write code I need to be back in <code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>

<p>Cold content exists to serve these needs. At the most basic level, cold content is just warm content that has been moved to a directory outside the reach of the warm pipeline. This is content I only touch with <code>$EDITOR</code>, like a normal code repository.</p>

<p>To fully turn warm content cold, there is a small amount of bookkeeping.</p>

<h3>Winter</h3>

<p>To handle this bookkeeping along with the other build pipeline steps, I wrote the <a href="https://twos.dev/winter">Winter</a> CLI. Winter can handle the process of converting warm content to cold like so:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">winter freeze DOCUMENT
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>which more or less performs a <code>git mv src/{cold,warm}/DOCUMENT.md</code> plus chips.</p>

<p>Winter also handles all the static generation. Writing my own generator was an
important step in building longevity into twos.dev because I often switch tools
when I discover a small feature I want but don't have (put simply: "oo shiny")
and that switching of tools is what eventually erodes the content.</p>

<p>Many static site generators are open source, but I'll often prefer to switch
tools than learn how to contribute if the barrier to entry contribution is
high, such as a language I don't like writing or an overly complex architecture.</p>

<p>Writing the generator myself guarantees that barrier is minimal. Writing it in
Go is a guarantee the code will not rot quickly or fall into dependency hell
after a few years without attention.</p>

<h3>Post-freeze</h3>

<p>After freezing my content I may also take one final step of permanently
rendering it to HTML if I've built more than a little code into it. Sure I can
always embed HTML in Markdown, but taking this extra step gives me all my editor
doodads and hardens the file against future changes to preprocessing.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">winter build
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">mv dist/DOCUMENT.html src/cold/DOCUMENT.html
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">git rm src/cold/DOCUMENT.md
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">git add src/cold/DOCUMENT.html
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>This brings back the weight of editing prose in HTML, but these cases are the minority and at this point most of the writing is done.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Allowing myself this escape hatch is freeing. I’m more encouraged to write interactive or otherwise bespoke components, and twos.dev becomes consistent by default but in a way I can break when I need (e.g. for a <a href="cv.html">CV</a>'s bicolumnar layout).</p>

<h2>On URLs Not Changing</h2>

<p>I use my website as a test bed for interesting technology. As a side effect, content has been lost over the years as it becomes hard to migrate to overhauled versions.</p>

<p>It so happens that by keeping my writing in Markdown or raw HTML/CSS, I make it easy to accomplish my second goal: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URLs don’t change</a>. I've removed the possibility that changing frontend or backend frameworks will leave my documents behind; Markdown is not going anywhere, and all the HTML files need to look decent is a header and footer. In the worst case scenario I'll simply <code>cp -r dist</code> to my next crazy system's web root.</p>

<p>If I’ve done things right, this web page will be accessible at twos.dev/meta.html for at least as long as I live.</p>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Inverted April Fool&#39;s&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love it when companies call their own bluffs on April Fool&#39;s Day. I like to&#xA;click into their pranks to see where the seam is. Are they &#34;launching a&#xA;new product&#34; but the only page to be found is a press release? Or, is&#xA;there a product page with a disabled Buy button? Sometimes the Buy button&#xA;works, but brings you to a page that says &#34;Fooled you!&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was never satisfied by these seams after witnessing first-hand the gold wacky&#xA;standard: On April 1, 2004, a popular search engine pranked that it was pivoting&#xA;into becoming an email service -- and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html&#34;&gt;it&#xA;did&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;This was especially surprising in the age before every startup was a data&#xA;company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Gmail was not created to remove a seam from an April Fool&#39;s Day&#xA;prank. It was made independently from April Fool’s Day, and someone decided it&#xA;would be funny to disguise its launch as a prank. But as a bystander the&#xA;effect is the same: it seems that they are calling their own bluffs. There&#39;s&#xA;no &#34;Fooled you!&#34; page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Calling Your Own Bluffs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always wanted more experiences like this, so I built one. I run a website&#xA;called &lt;a href=&#34;https://splits.io&#34;&gt;Splits.io&lt;/a&gt; whose goal is to help&#xA;speedrunners (people who time themselves playing video games) play faster.&#xA;It&#39;s a niche site, but we have paying customers and about 10k monthly active&#xA;users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For April Fool&#39;s Day in 2020, we launched a full-page takeover introducing a&#xA;feature to help people speedrun faster: the urgent need to use the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We joked that we would ship them a spicy hot sauce which they could use as a&#xA;sort of gastrointestinal negative reinforcement. But when people clicked Buy,&#xA;they did not see &#34;Fooled you!&#34;, but a form to enter their payment&#xA;information. And when they entered their payment information and pressed&#xA;submit, they received a receipt in their inbox. And a charge to their card. A&#xA;week later, a package would show up at their door.&#xA;We called all our bluffs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted people to receive real hot sauce, and I knew it couldn&#39;t just&#xA;be any hot sauce from the grocery store. The April Fool&#39;s takeover was going&#xA;to advertise a Splits.io-branded hot sauce, and we were going to give it to&#xA;them. I called it &lt;em&gt;Race to the Bottom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Sauce&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t want to deal with actually making or bottling a product like hot&#xA;sauce but you still want one sporting your own brand, the main option is to&#xA;work with a&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;white label&lt;/strong&gt; company, i.e. one that does every step of making a&#xA;traditional product except for the branding. Instead of selling to consumers&#xA;or retailers, they sell to those with a brand and nothing else. This could be&#xA;someone who&#39;s just amazing at branding and needs a supplier, or it could be&#xA;your employer making some commemorative swag, or it could be an engineer&#xA;trying to make a dumb April Fool&#39;s Day joke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A surprising number of household brands use white label products behind the&#xA;scenes, namely store brands. Because the customers of these white label&#xA;companies are often large businesses, there&#39;s not a pressing need for&#xA;self-service like in consumer retail. That means it can take some phone tag&#xA;and email threads to get the relationship hammered out. But still, it works --&#xA;19% of the US economy is made up of white label goods&#xA;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/topics/1076/private-label-market/#topicHeader__wrapper&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily the last few years have seen some self-service white label products&#xA;enter the market, propelled I think by the demand for startup swag. For&#xA;something as niche as hot sauce, though, the best we could hope for was&#xA;partial automation. I engaged with several vendors and ordered sample packs&#xA;from two -- one via self-service for $25 and one via phone call for free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I made some chips, invited some friends over (pre-pandemic), and got to&#xA;work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;  &#34;Taste testing hot sauces.&#34;&#xA;  &#34;trialing&#34;&#xA;  &#34;several hot sauce bottles around a plate, with part of each bottle poured into a spot on the plate that allows for dipping&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We selected a hot sauce called Pale Ale Chipotle and the company rated its&#xA;spiciness as 8/10 (no Scoville rating).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Label&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re a small team with no designer, so I cracked open Acorn and spent way too&#xA;long making way too ugly a label.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;  &#34;The final label for Race to the Bottom.

So one year later, we suddenly got another influx of orders. Luckily I&#xA;still had plenty of stock with expiration dates still over a year away, so&#xA;spent a little surprise day packing hot sauce again -- and again a third time,&#xA;another year later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Finances&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the sample packs and the bulk order of 48 bottles (the minimum), upfront&#xA;costs came to $&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(192.05. Over three April Fool&#39;s Days we sold 28 bottles in 25&#xA;orders at \)&lt;/span&gt;$15 / bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cost of my labor and the boon to the brand are harder to calculate. I&#39;ll&#xA;call them a wash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Revenue&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Orders: $15*28   =  $ 420.00&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Costs&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Samples:           ($  25.00)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Hot sauce:         ($ 167.05)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Shipping: $9*25  = ($ 225.00)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Profit/loss ----------------&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    $   2.95&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting paid $2.95 to live out a minor dream of building a seamless April Fool&#39;s&#xA;Day joke was a great deal. I&#39;d have paid a lot more just for the joy of seeing&#xA;people&#39;s reactions in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the way, I learned how white labels work and how big a slice of the economy&#xA;they make up, which has changed how I think about brands. Sometimes you have to&#xA;be a little wacky to learn something new about the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>Inverted April Fool's</h1>

<p>I love it when companies call their own bluffs on April Fool's Day. I like to
click into their pranks to see where the seam is. Are they "launching a
new product" but the only page to be found is a press release? Or, is
there a product page with a disabled Buy button? Sometimes the Buy button
works, but brings you to a page that says "Fooled you!".</p>

<p>I was never satisfied by these seams after witnessing first-hand the gold wacky
standard: On April 1, 2004, a popular search engine pranked that it was pivoting
into becoming an email service -- and then <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html">it
did</a>.
This was especially surprising in the age before every startup was a data
company.</p>

<p>Of course, Gmail was not created to remove a seam from an April Fool's Day
prank. It was made independently from April Fool’s Day, and someone decided it
would be funny to disguise its launch as a prank. But as a bystander the
effect is the same: it seems that they are calling their own bluffs. There's
no "Fooled you!" page.</p>

<h2>Calling Your Own Bluffs</h2>

<p>I always wanted more experiences like this, so I built one. I run a website
called <a href="https://splits.io">Splits.io</a> whose goal is to help
speedrunners (people who time themselves playing video games) play faster.
It's a niche site, but we have paying customers and about 10k monthly active
users.</p>

<p>For April Fool's Day in 2020, we launched a full-page takeover introducing a
feature to help people speedrun faster: the urgent need to use the bathroom.</p>

<p>We joked that we would ship them a spicy hot sauce which they could use as a
sort of gastrointestinal negative reinforcement. But when people clicked Buy,
they did not see "Fooled you!", but a form to enter their payment
information. And when they entered their payment information and pressed
submit, they received a receipt in their inbox. And a charge to their card. A
week later, a package would show up at their door.
We called all our bluffs.</p>

<h2>The Set Up</h2>

<p>I knew I wanted people to receive real hot sauce, and I knew it couldn't just
be any hot sauce from the grocery store. The April Fool's takeover was going
to advertise a Splits.io-branded hot sauce, and we were going to give it to
them. I called it <em>Race to the Bottom</em>.</p>

<h3>The Sauce</h3>

<p>If you don't want to deal with actually making or bottling a product like hot
sauce but you still want one sporting your own brand, the main option is to
work with a
<strong>white label</strong> company, i.e. one that does every step of making a
traditional product except for the branding. Instead of selling to consumers
or retailers, they sell to those with a brand and nothing else. This could be
someone who's just amazing at branding and needs a supplier, or it could be
your employer making some commemorative swag, or it could be an engineer
trying to make a dumb April Fool's Day joke.</p>

<p>A surprising number of household brands use white label products behind the
scenes, namely store brands. Because the customers of these white label
companies are often large businesses, there's not a pressing need for
self-service like in consumer retail. That means it can take some phone tag
and email threads to get the relationship hammered out. But still, it works --
19% of the US economy is made up of white label goods
(<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1076/private-label-market/#topicHeader__wrapper">source</a>).</p>

<p>Luckily the last few years have seen some self-service white label products
enter the market, propelled I think by the demand for startup swag. For
something as niche as hot sauce, though, the best we could hope for was
partial automation. I engaged with several vendors and ordered sample packs
from two -- one via self-service for $25 and one via phone call for free.</p>

<p>Then I made some chips, invited some friends over (pre-pandemic), and got to
work.</p>

<p>{{ img
  "Taste testing hot sauces."
  "trialing"
  "several hot sauce bottles around a plate, with part of each bottle poured into a spot on the plate that allows for dipping"
}}</p>

<p>We selected a hot sauce called Pale Ale Chipotle and the company rated its
spiciness as 8/10 (no Scoville rating).</p>

<h3>The Label</h3>

<p>We're a small team with no designer, so I cracked open Acorn and spent way too
long making way too ugly a label.</p>

<p>{{ img
  "The final label for Race to the Bottom. We were also trialing an energy drink, but scrapped it at the last minute."
  "label"
  "a hot sauce label reading 'Race to the bottom: A speedrunner's hot sauce' in the Splits.io colors"
}}</p>

<p>The white label company sent me a template with requirements such as how to
print the volume of the sauce within compliance, and the right proportions for
the label. They took care of the nutrition facts and bar code.</p>

<h2>Launch Day</h2>

<p>We set up everything to happen automatically. The code had been deployed days
earlier, with JavaScript just waiting for the day to tick over before doing
the takeover. The announcement tweet was scheduled ahead of time as well.
The response when the clock struck midnight was exactly as we hoped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>its actually real wtf</p>

}}</p>

<h3>Shipping</h3>

<p>I went into this expecting to make bulk trips to the post office, but I
actually never had to leave the house -- usps.com allows you to schedule a
mail carrier to pick up packages during their mail route. I had padded
flat-rate envelopes ready, also delivered from their website. On April 1st,
here was my pipeline:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Trigger) Receive “payment completed” email from Stripe</li>
<li>Pay for a shipping label at usps.com (~$9)</li>
<li>Print shipping label, affix to a padded envelope with scotch tape</li>
<li>Pack in hot sauce and extra packing material</li>
<li>Schedule a pickup at usps.com</li>
<li>(On pickup day) Put queued package(s) on the porch</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Surprises</h2>

<p>I built the full-page takeover to check if the day was April 1 when deciding
whether to take over or lie dormant, but I didn't think about checking the
year. So one year later, we suddenly got another influx of orders. Luckily I
still had plenty of stock with expiration dates still over a year away, so
spent a little surprise day packing hot sauce again -- and again a third time,

<h2>Finances</h2>

<p>After the sample packs and the bulk order of 48 bottles (the minimum), upfront
costs came to $<span class="math inline">\(192.05. Over three April Fool's Days we sold 28 bottles in 25
orders at \)</span>$15 / bottle.</p>

<p>The cost of my labor and the boon to the brand are harder to calculate. I'll
call them a wash.</p>

<p>I'll take it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Getting paid $2.95 to live out a minor dream of building a seamless April Fool's
Day joke was a great deal. I'd have paid a lot more just for the joy of seeing
people's reactions in real time.</p>

<p>On the way, I learned how white labels work and how big a slice of the economy
they make up, which has changed how I think about brands. Sometimes you have to
be a little wacky to learn something new about the world.</p>

   &#xA;  &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My life is in Google more than anyone I know. The usual suspects sure&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;Gmail,&#xA;Photos, Chrome, etc.&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;but also the ones people stay away from&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;Tasks, Keep,&#xA;YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp;amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We&#xA;have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook,&#xA;the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the&#xA;“Google graveyard”. And for a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture&#xA;with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it&#39;s no surprise I’ve&#xA;been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is&#xA;how I understand why&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;or whether&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;I prefer what I chose. For Android, that&#xA;means trialing an iPhone. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&amp;amp;t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw&#34;&gt;I did&#xA;this&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;five years ago for a few months (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://bensw.com&#34;&gt;bensw&lt;/a&gt;), but&#xA;afterwards I thought &#34;It&#39;s actually not that different, it&#39;s just that the&#xA;Google apps don&#39;t feel native, so I’ll stick with Android&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&#39;ve realized it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition&#xA;without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the same reason Google apps&#xA;don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn&#39;t shine if you only use Google apps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an honest,&#xA;holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me out, but better to&#xA;trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know&#xA;one. These are my notes on hopping the fence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Broad Themes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I&#39;ll summarize&#xA;the themes I&#39;ve witnessed during them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;safety&#34;&gt;Safety vs. Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I&#39;d long ago published its&#xA;Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding denial after denial.&#xA;I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user, and I could see with fresh&#xA;eyes the effects of the strictness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating system. They&#xA;don&#39;t feel like they were written by others, and that makes me feel safe. My&#xA;data feels like part of my device, not part of Google. And I trust my device&#xA;to manage my payment, location, etc. data, because it is mine. I own it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight for it.&#xA;But it&#39;s a good feeling. And it only comes with control&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;control by a&#xA;representative I trust, over parties I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know app developers,&#xA;especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through them I can trust app&#xA;developers, but only because Apple so heavily controls what they can publish.&#xA;They can&#39;t send me to their sketchy site or use dark patterns to trick me into&#xA;paying them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don&#39;t feel safe, I have&#xA;the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I have &#34;the choice&#34; to do&#xA;a food safety inspection of every restaurant I visit, but I do not want to and&#xA;I wouldn&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking for, so I trust my local health department. This allows me to visit any restaurant stress-free, without food safety taking up space in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go through&#xA;the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means Apple takes a cut&#xA;of everything. As a user, this means one central place where I can manage&#xA;(read: cancel) subscriptions&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;no digging through menus or talking to customer&#xA;service agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ imgs&#xA;   &#34;The App Store&#39;s subscriptions management menus.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;subscriptions&#34;&#xA;   &#34;Screenshot of iOS App Store showing multiple active subscriptions&#34;&#xA;   &#34;subscription&#34;&#xA;   &#34;iOS App Store showing options to change or cancel a subscription&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party auth&#xA;providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means building&#xA;another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this means I get a native,&#xA;one-tap, FaceID sign-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video &#34;Signing in with Apple.&#34; &#34;signin&#34; }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see the more&#xA;I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing &#34;public goods&#34;,&#xA;whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad clickthrough&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;data, eyeballs,&#xA;and engagement. Of course, this has its problems. Apple is a private company,&#xA;not elected officials, so is only as beholden to its end users as it wants to&#xA;be. For now, the incentives seem aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;offline&#34;&gt;Offline-first vs. Online-first Design&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in attitude&#xA;Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user identity. To&#xA;Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is just a window into that&#xA;account. The device may have some caching and synchronization to remain useful&#xA;offline, but ultimately Google&#39;s servers are the source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data between&#xA;multiple devices, but it&#39;s just that&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;synchronization. Apps usually wait until&#xA;the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you can even still perform a&#xA;first-class OS-level sync of all your data to another device with a cable&#xA;instead of iCloud. You can also opt to keep everything local.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways these differences are expressed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Google wants a blurry line between web and native experiences; its official&#xA;apps are going the way of PWAs and similar tech that can be deployed to web&#xA;and app ~identically. In contrast Apple puts every major UX flow in a native&#xA;app, from email and calendar to bug reporting and account management. Even&#xA;uploading apps to the App Store for publishing&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;a fundamentally online&#xA;experience&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;is a native macOS app.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Google Docs documents are rows in a database. Apple Pages documents are files&#xA;on a filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a phone&#xA;number or email), not an Apple account&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;even if the bubble is blue. You may&#xA;even be unknowingly using a combination of phone and email for one contact,&#xA;because iMessage silently interleaves them if they&#39;re owned by the same Apple&#xA;account. If that person later removes one from their Apple account, your&#xA;iMessage thread with them retroactively splits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call from your&#xA;computer, you&#39;re going through Google&#39;s servers. In the Apple ecosystem,&#xA;when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad, you&#39;re connecting&#xA;locally to your iPhone to route the call.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic&#xA;always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly&#xA;experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a machine&#xA;are centralized in iCloud settings where they&#39;re often off by default. I still&#xA;can&#39;t get one of my Safaris to synchronize its bookmarks with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;committment&#34;&gt;Commitment vs. Experimentation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google is infamous for killing products. They release early, often, and in&#xA;isolation; see Hangouts and Allo, Meet and Duo, or Reminders and Tasks.&#xA;Innovation comes first and stablizing the product offering comes second, when&#xA;the product is proven (or not proven) to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple instead takes the &#34;measure twice, cut once&#34; approach; products are&#xA;rarely released and rarely killed. The iPod was around for 21 years,&#xA;co-existing with the iPhone for 12 of them. Apple Maps was a notoriously&#xA;failed app at launch in 2012 and still suffers from that reputational injury,&#xA;however &lt;em&gt;it&#39;s still around anyway&lt;/em&gt; and has improved drastically (although&#xA;whether enough is &lt;a href=&#34;#maps&#34;&gt;still in question&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google&#39;s reputation for killing products causes a negative feedback loop. When&#xA;Google releases a product that relies on market buy-in&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;say, a watch OS (needs&#xA;app developer buy-in) or a chat app (needs consumer buy-in)&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it&#39;s an uphill&#xA;battle to get the market on board, because it knows Google may turn around and&#xA;kill the product anyway. This lack of buy-in seals the product&#39;s fate, and it&#xA;goes to the graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Apple&#39;s reputation for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; killing products causes the market to&#xA;embrace it with open arms, kicking off a positive feedback loop that ensures its&#xA;success. iPad needed developers to design for a different form factor to be&#xA;successful, and they did. Apple Watch needed developers to design watch flows&#xA;for their app to be successful, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are more factors at play than reputation, like developer experience and&#xA;user experience, but the point stands&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;a reputation for killing products&#xA;contributes to more product deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;specifics&#34;&gt;Specific Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are my notes on moving between the ecosystems at specific touchpoints. To&#xA;see an overview, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;#toc&#34;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;key&#34;&gt;Key&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;✔ = Switch successful; happily using Apple product&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ⅹ = Switch unsuccessful; moved back to Google or to another product&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⚠ = Nuance ahead&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;macos&#34;&gt;✔ ArchLinux → macOS&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a decade,&#xA;so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass migration. I grew up&#xA;gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for development due to a love of the&#xA;POSIX command line and the simplicity of the system. I found macOS to scratch&#xA;the same itches without the days spent customizing and debugging things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use to&#xA;apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and, including taps, a&#xA;breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it) the AUR. It also bundles its&#xA;own service management, e.g.&#xA;&lt;code&gt;brew services start postgresql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between Windows&#xA;security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It&#39;s good enough that it&#xA;stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I&#39;ll have to type my password&#xA;to unlock 1Password here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The app ethos on macOS is that all apps are self-contained &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files, and&#xA;uninstalling an app is defined as &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;ing that file. It&#39;s spoiled me to&#xA;hesitation when I encounter the rare app that needs an installer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half the apps I use are available on the macOS App Store. For apps it&#xA;manages, it handles updates, payments, and even&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting_app_store_reviews&#34;&gt;prompts for&#xA;review&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;I generally look there first when searching for an app, then Homebrew (if I know&#xA;what I&#39;m looking for), then Google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ipad&#34;&gt;✔ Nexus 7 → iPad&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it should&#xA;give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user to be&#xA;using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the&#xA;tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually worse than using the&#xA;same app on my phone. I expected a more polished but overall similar&#xA;experience from iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some light&#xA;computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the form factor; apps&#xA;use it to display more and differently laid out information. Generally, the&#xA;extra horizontal space is used to persistently display a nav menu or the&#xA;previous screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ imgs&#xA;   &#34;Wikipedia on iPhone vs. iPad.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;iphone&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPhone&#34;&#xA;   &#34;ipad&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPad, using extra space for navigation&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw this as a&#xA;marketing move, but I&#39;ve learned they really did push the needle more in the&#xA;direction of general-purpose computing. The three features that did it for me&#xA;are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multiple windows for one app&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Files app&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better multitasking&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but being able&#xA;to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply feels great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second monitor, and&#xA;the ability to use my Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control the iPad. macOS’s&#xA;Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input device for signing documents&#xA;and marking up images. This is something I did before by manually transferring&#xA;files, but now it’s two clicks with instant sync.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;iphone&#34;&gt;✔ Pixel → iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was initially surprised iPhone and iPad lack feature parity. This first came&#xA;up trying to swipe-type on iPad. Another is iPad can show multiple apps on the&#xA;screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay. I felt&#xA;confused at first, but I see Apple’s angle&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;none of these quite make sense on&#xA;the other form factor. They’d rather deny you the feature than allow using it to&#xA;be confusing or unintuitive. Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad&#xA;because Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more native apps I use on iOS, the better the UX gets. For example, you&#xA;can use multi-touch to drag-and-drop items between apps. Third-party apps only&#xA;implement this functionality sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ videos&#xA;&#34;Using multi-touch to drag and drop items between apps.&#34;&#xA;&#34;drag-photos&#34;&#xA;&#34;drag-text&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FaceID is about on par with fingerprint unlock on Pixel. They each encounter&#xA;their own situational troubles, but both are great overall and I&#39;m no more or&#xA;less happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;fi&#34;&gt;Google Fi&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier. We&#xA;decided to stay with it because they&#39;d recently started to officially support&#xA;iPhone. However, after about a year we found out that Google Fi had been&#xA;intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages from iPhones, leading one friend&#xA;(I hope only one) and I to think we were ghosting each other. Once I learned&#xA;this, Summer and I immediately switched off Google Fi to T-Mobile, which had a&#xA;close ethical alignment around contracts and data usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I can&#39;t&#xA;see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and long-term bug that&#xA;was never even communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;notifications&#34;&gt;Notifications&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference&#xA;makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call them a sidegrade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on&#xA;your phone then read that email on any platform, the notification goes away.&#xA;Otherwise, the notification will be there even days later. In this way,&#xA;Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the notification is&#xA;(usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the phone is unlocked the&#xA;notification moves to a secondary location “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen.&#xA;I do inbox zero, so this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications&#xA;by committing the cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers in the&#xA;corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android notifications&#xA;are, so can be used as a todo list. They&#39;re a decent enough substitute that&#xA;although I still prefer Android’s notifications, the difference is a couple of&#xA;orders of magnitude less impactful than I scoped it out as.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;imessage&#34;&gt;iMessage&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about&#xA;“solving” mobile chat&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it’s been solved for them for years. iMessage is the&#xA;gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the guilty urge to nudge friends&#xA;towards iPhone so I can use it with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To users iMessage threads appear to be between contacts, but on the backend&#xA;they&#39;re between contact methods like phone numbers or email addresses. Along&#xA;with Apple&#39;s device-first philosophy I presume this is so people don&#39;t need an&#xA;Apple account to use iMessage, but it has quite a few papercuts. I recently&#xA;changed my email address but I need to keep my old one in my Apple account&#xA;indefinitely so my friends’ threads with me (read: with my old email address)&#xA;won’t retroactively split. I&#39;ve also encountered unsolvable problems spinning up&#xA;group chats with &lt;a href=&#34;https://jm.dev&#34;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; since he switched to a Japanese phone number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these rare issues I&#39;m very happy with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iMessage include rich embedded media from all other Apple&#xA;products like Photos, Music, and Maps, and automatically entering SMS 2FA codes&#xA;on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;Signing into a website on macOS using the SMS 2FA code from iPhone.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;2fa&#34;&#xA;   &#34;Screenshot of a 2FA prompt suggesting an auto-fill from iMessage&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;watch&#34;&gt;✔ Moto 360 → Apple Watch&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My relationship with the Moto 360 was on and off. To me it served two&#xA;functions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let me check the time without taking out my phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let me check a notification without taking out my phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These were helpful functions, but the work of managing an extra battery to&#xA;charge and an extra device to put on and take off made me fluctuate every six&#xA;months or so between wearing it every day and not wearing it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Watch adds enough bullet points that I&#39;ve had no such fluctuations&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;I&#xA;wear it daily:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unlock macOS/iOS when nearby, in lieu of entering a password/passcode&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vibrate in patterns for Apple Maps navigation directions (e.g. one pattern&#xA;for upcoming left, another for upcoming right)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pay using Apple Pay by tapping&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shazam a song without taking out your phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Show popped reminders or upcoming calendar events on the watch face&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Control Keynote presentations (e.g. tap for next slide)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;View your phone&#39;s camera viewfinder live and tap to snap (e.g. for group&#xA;photos)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Control media playback&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#34;Walkie-talkie&#34; with a close friend&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above, the third-party app ecosystem plays ball with Apple&#xA;Watch a lot more than the Android app ecosystem does with Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;appletv&#34;&gt;✔ Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have HomePods and Summer forbids me to get any (reasonably) after&#xA;filling our home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey&#xA;Google, play &lt;code&gt;$SHOW&lt;/code&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to casting from your phone Apple TV and Chromecast are both good,&#xA;but Chromecast shines brighter. Casting is a first-class citizen on Chromecast&#xA;because it&#39;s all you have. I&#39;ve seen more apps expose a Chromecast icon than an&#xA;AirPlay icon, and casting to an Apple TV that&#39;s asleep sometimes just turns it&#xA;on without playing anything. We now just use the remote as our default control&#xA;mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;remote&#34;&gt;The Remote&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that it&#39;s&#xA;pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use;&#xA;I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it has a good build quality. It&#39;s not IR,&#xA;so you don&#39;t have to point it at anything. Because the Apple TV can forward&#xA;incoming buttonpresses to the attached television, it&#39;s a strict upgrade even for television controls&#xA;like volume adjustment. But it’s a remote, and can&#xA;be lost or have sticky liquids spiked into it like any other. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that keeps it on the side of the coffee table. I&#xA;miss the remote-free life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is selected on&#xA;the Apple TV, a notification shows on my iOS devices allowing me to use them&#xA;as a keyboard. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for&#xA;invoking 1Password to fill logins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;home&#34;&gt;✔ Google Home → Apple Home&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent building up&#xA;our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a Raspberry Pi made it all&#xA;work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV showing our Nest doorbell camera&#xA;picture-in-picture when the doorbell rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a&#xA;Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home Hub.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list that&#xA;feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT gateway,&#xA;having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center pull-down menus, and&#xA;hooking up more devices through automation with Shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;airpods&#34;&gt;✔ Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true.&#xA;Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my&#xA;ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs, even for flights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775&#34;&gt;Spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; is literally too good;&#xA;I had to turn it off. Again and again I became very nervous that I was blasting&#xA;sound from my speakers, so I would have to briefly remove one earbud to ensure&#xA;I wasn&#39;t. The anxiety of this was so distracting as to be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between devices based&#xA;on attention, a Siri integration slightly worse than Pixel Buds&#39;s Google&#xA;Assistant integration, and spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mail&#34;&gt;⚠ Gmail → iCloud Mail&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I control&#xA;anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;migrating&#34;&gt;Migrating Emails&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the experience&#xA;was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired result. After&#xA;starting from scratch several times and hitting new issues every time, I’ve&#xA;chosen to live the life of searching in two places when I need something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;migratingaddresses&#34;&gt;Migrating Email Addresses&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To migrate email addresses I made a very tough decision that I&#39;m still&#xA;frustrated years later that I had to make, which was to change Google accounts&#xA;during the transition. To use iCloud Mail means I can&#39;t use &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;, and&#xA;I&#39;ve been wanting to migrate to a domain I control anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I wanted my email address on my Google account to match&#xA;my true email address, and Google doesn&#39;t let you change your primary email&#xA;address. You can add additional &#34;contact&#34; email addresses, but your account is&#xA;still very much bound to the original address you signed up for. If you try to&#xA;do this anyway, like I did, there are a lot of little knock-on effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One is that accepting calendar invitations adds your Google account as an&#xA;invitee to the event (confusing the organizer, who won&#39;t recognize it). And&#xA;because your Google account wasn&#39;t invited by the organizer, joining Meet&#xA;meetings means you first get dumped into a waiting room from which the&#xA;organizer has to approve you. This is especially frustrating when the&#xA;organizer doesn&#39;t show up, but the meeting is still happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google Groups also behaves poorly, as you&#39;ll get added to groups by your true&#xA;email address but you&#39;ll join as a Google account, forcing your web-based&#xA;replies to be from your Google account&#39;s email address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my first effort to migrate Google accounts, I coopted ben@twos.dev from&#xA;Google Workspace which I had used for a little consulting. This caused a&#xA;few minor issues and UX hiccups because Workspace Gmail believed it was&#xA;still my provider, even though a non-Gmail server was receiving my emails.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried to use this Google Workspace account as my new primary Google account.&#xA;But many Google features don&#39;t support Workspace accounts, like Google One,&#xA;family sharing, some security features, and (for better and worse) some types&#xA;of data harvesting and therefore ad/search targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve now landed on creating a new personal Google account with ben@twos.dev as&#xA;its primary email address. I needed to delete the twos.dev Google Workspace&#xA;organization to do this, as it had claim to ben@twos.dev already. Signing up&#xA;to Google without an &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address is a somewhat hidden option, but it&#xA;exists. You just can&#39;t ever fall into their &#34;upgrade&#34; funnel which assigns you&#xA;an &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address, because that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; change your primary email address&#xA;and there&#39;s no way back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of this would be so frustrating if there weren&#39;t so many things tied to my&#xA;Google account, like all my Maps reviews, my Chat/Hangouts history from decades&#xA;ago, and my purchased Play content. I really wanted to keep my account, but&#xA;there&#39;s just no way to do that with a new email address without experiencing too&#xA;many little hiccups to be worth it. The one thing I could smoothly transfer over&#xA;was YouTube. Everything else was surprisingly as &#34;walled garden&#34; as you&#39;d expect&#xA;from an Apple product, just in subtler ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;daily&#34;&gt;Daily Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve installed&#xA;Thunderbird to get by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and has a&#xA;solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail&#39;s junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk folder,&#xA;even after months of correcting it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud Drive links&#xA;instead (Google has this same behavior with Drive), but I&#39;ve had recipients experience trouble downloading them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail&#39;s search is bad. On macOS, it searches only the mailbox being viewed&#xA;(e.g. Inbox) by default. Because I do inbox zero, this is never what I want to&#xA;search. (iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by default.) When you are&#xA;done searching and click Inbox to &#34;return home&#34; the search field doesn&#39;t&#xA;clear, leading you to believe your Inbox is empty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring that, Gmail still wins search by an order of magnitude. For example,&#xA;Gmail searches the contents of PDFs attached to emails; I’ve found this&#xA;invaluable finding old leases and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail is below average at threading emails:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once in a while, it omits an email from a thread that it shouldn’t have.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When replying to a thread, the sent email doesn&#39;t appear immediately in the local&#xA;view, which makes it seem like something has gone wrong with the sending.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When marking a thread as &#34;Notify&#34; (a nice feature which forces updates to the thread&#xA;to send a push notification even when they&#39;re off), emails sent into the thread by you&#xA;trigger the push. Even emails from the same platform and app that is in charge of&#xA;notifying.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I experience long, uncollapsible nested quotes in some threads, where&#xA;Gmail was always good at collapsing them automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail is bad at converting text to rich text. For example, it will not automatically&#xA;convert markdown-esque lists (e.g. &lt;code&gt;1. Some text&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;- Some text&lt;/code&gt;) to rich text lists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service has a&#xA;separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have disparate&#xA;feature sets and don&#39;t synchronize. iOS Mail does not support filters. I’ve&#xA;opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because the iCloud filters can only&#xA;check one condition per filter, and I just have my iMac stay awake 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to archive.&#xA;Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for any app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;Any app&#39;s menu actions (e.g. File → Save) can be [re]bound.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;rebind&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of macOS&#39;s Settings.app rebinding a key for Mail.app&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want a Mail-like experience with Gmail as a backend, instead of using&#xA;SMTP I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://mimestream.com&#34;&gt;Mimestream&lt;/a&gt;; it is written by a former&#xA;Apple Mail engineer to have a similar UX but using proper Gmail APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in Spotlight&#xA;and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;calendar&#34;&gt;⚠ Google Calendar → Apple Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I switched to Apple Calendar as both an app and a calendar provider. I&#39;d&#xA;forgotten how limited and finicky calendar protocols are at their core&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;so many&#xA;things just stop working when you leave Google Calendar. Folks send me&#xA;invitations that don&#39;t show, my RSVPs don&#39;t make it back to them, and I&#xA;sometimes don&#39;t receive updates to events. Even unfurling invited mailing lists&#xA;into individuals (who can then RSVP individuallly) is specific to Google&#xA;Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I switched my provider back to Google Calendar about 18 months in while&#xA;continuing to use the Apple Calendar app. It&#39;s a much better experience while&#xA;sacrificing virtually nothing in ecosystem benefits. I also get to avoid the&#xA;crappy Apple Calendar web UI those few times I need my calendar on Windows, and&#xA;I get the more powerful sharing / RSVP tools of Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the Apple Calendar iOS and macOS apps, I don&#39;t recommend using the Week&#xA;view. Like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to&#xA;represent the current time of day; but this bar extends 100% of the width of the&#xA;week, and does not do a good job showing you which day today is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it is?&#34;&#xA;   &#34;calendar&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of Calendar.app on macOS showing a week with a red line across it.&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing panic&#xA;about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar only shows&#xA;when viewing today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say they&#xA;appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a calendar invitation&#xA;there are two attachments, &lt;code&gt;invite.ics&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mime-attachment.ics&lt;/code&gt;. Each will pop&#xA;up a Calendar float to add the event. I don&#39;t know the difference; since&#xA;switching to Google Calendar as a backend I&#39;ve learned to RSVP using the&#xA;embedded buttons which (outside of Gmail) open a web browser to the Google&#xA;Calendar UI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video&#xA;  &#34;Opening a Google Calendar invitation from within the Apple ecosystem.&#34;&#xA;  &#34;mail&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed to&#xA;have a refresh in a decade. Apple Calendar can automatically generate “travel&#xA;to” and “travel from” events based on the travel time between locations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps, Siri suggestions&#xA;for navigation destinations and video calls, and the ability to longpress dates and times in iMessage to create events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;maps&#34;&gt;⚠ Google Maps → Apple Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly so. But&#xA;that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved. Unfortunately it’s&#xA;only gotten good, not great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are UX benefits over Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past&#xA;this light, then at the next one, turn &lt;code&gt;$DIRECTION&lt;/code&gt;”, but about 5% of my trips&#xA;to new places end me at the right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been&#xA;routed to the delivery entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an airport,&#xA;and the wrong parking lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) for a store in a large&#xA;shopping center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos, menus,&#xA;ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here; their purchase&#xA;of Yelp means they inherit photos &amp;amp; reviews, but even that can&#39;t beat the&#xA;sheer volume Google Maps. I&#39;ve only seen one or two restaurants with ordering&#xA;functionality enabled. Many business hours are out of date&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;I update them when I&#xA;notice, but I&#39;m just one person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and Calendar,&#xA;Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other sources, and Apple&#xA;Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming turns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;byemaps&#34;&gt;Departure&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to continue to give Apple Maps chances because I know more data helps, but for tight&#xA;schedules I wouldn&#39;t chance it. Incidentally, we purchased a Polestar which has Google&#xA;Maps built right into it, so I&#39;ve begun to softly switch back to that even on my other&#xA;devices simply for the cross-integration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;findmy&#34;&gt;✔ Location Sharing → Find My&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends and&#xA;family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple offering (a&#xA;separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one would be happy with&#xA;the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must launch&#xA;with intention, but it&#39;s a wash for me&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;I&#39;ve had serendipitous encounters&#xA;enabled by seeing a friend is close by in Google Maps accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AirTags and device tracking are the big Apple killer feature here, which work&#xA;as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one in my bag just to&#xA;have peace of mind. The app sends a notification when I leave &lt;code&gt;$DEVICE&lt;/code&gt; at&#xA;&lt;code&gt;$LOCATION&lt;/code&gt;, with easy controls to disable future notifications for any such&#xA;combination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;✔ Google Photos → Apple Photos&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly, these two products are equivalent. Apple Photos has more powerful&#xA;editing tools but Google Photos has more powerful search. Both have similar&#xA;tooling around memories, viewing photos on maps or by year, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classically, Google has a better web experience and Apple has a better native&#xA;experience, meaning sharing photos with others is better in Apple Photos if and&#xA;only if you&#39;re sharing with other Apple users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;ve been getting more into photography I&#39;ve come to like how smooth the&#xA;import experience is in macOS&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;insert SD card, Photos.app automatically opens up&#xA;to the Import window, I tick &#34;Automatically delete photos after import&#34; and tell&#xA;it go, and it&#39;s done. I can take the SD card out and the photos will upload in&#xA;the background. The Google equivalent isn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; but it takes more&#xA;babysitting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The migration from Google Photos to Apple Photos was simple, but long. Google&#xA;Takeout produced hundreds of gigabytes of exports, which I downloaded onto a Mac&#xA;and then imported with Photos.app. Due to Apple&#39;s offline-first approach&#xA;synchronization took place in the background at reduced speeds. This meant it&#xA;tried to take place while the laptop was closed and charging. This was jarring&#xA;at first when trying to babysit the process, as by design it stops performing&#xA;well when you start using the machine. When I learned to let go, it showed its&#xA;colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects include rich embeds &amp;amp; commenting in iMessage, and photos&#xA;appearing in upload prompts on all platforms (e.g. when uploading an avatar to&#xA;some random internet account) with full face search embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;safari&#34;&gt;⚠ Chrome → Safari&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from&#xA;bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the Chrome&#xA;chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone applications even&#xA;when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go backward or forward slides&#xA;the page on/off screen allowing you to peek without navigating, but it&#xA;backfires and feels artificial for low-travel anchor links and some&#xA;single-page app transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the&#xA;navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can&#39;t&#xA;identify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it works it&#39;s beautiful and useful, but when it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s jarring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video &#34;Navigating through history in Safari with swipe gestures.&#34; &#34;back&#34;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced some&#xA;webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others (local only); Meet also supports&#xA;more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one tab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff (move a browsing session between&#xA;devices smoothly) and the downright bonkers power efficiency of Safari on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;keychain&#34;&gt;ⅹ iCloud Keychain&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While moving to Safari, I replaced 1Password with iCloud Keychain. It serves&#xA;basic needs, but that’s it. It can store a username, a password, a 2FA code,&#xA;and a domain name for each entry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It cannot store two domains for one entry, e.g. gmail.com and google.com. It&#xA;cannot store arbitrary notes on an entry, e.g. the PIN that T-Mobile customer&#xA;service agents ask for. It cannot name an entry, e.g. Washington Corporations&#xA;and Charities System instead of ccfs.sos.wa.gov. It cannot store non-login&#xA;entries like documents, ID numbers, or insurance information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the 2FA field involves manual effort. Scanning rarely works, so I enter&#xA;the 2FA secret by copying and pasting the code. Some sites provide a raw code,&#xA;while others wrap the code in a URL that contains other metadata. 1Password&#xA;accepts either, but iCloud Keychain assumes you hand it a code; if you hand it&#xA;a URL it will silently accept it but produce incorrect codes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I moved back to 1Password.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include faster and more fluid autofill&#xA;support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;numbers&#34;&gt;✔ Google Sheets → Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a casual spreadsheets user, Sheets and Numbers are nearly identical.&#xA;Numbers has nicer UX when editing formulae that visualizes cell(s) being&#xA;referenced. It tries to humanize references, e.g. “Ben age” for a cell in a&#xA;row with header “Ben” and a column with header “Age”, instead of A:123. This&#xA;is nice until headers get long and multiworded. Overall it’s a wash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there&#39;s obviously a real social benefit to using Google Sheets if you have need of&#xA;sharing them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Numbers include Spotlight integration for quickly opening a sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;!--&#xA;### Google Docs → Pages {#pages}&#xA;&#xA;(To be filled in; I have not had much Pages experience.)&#xA;--&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;ⅹ Keep → Apple Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;get out of my way and let me&#xA;write. Let me deal with organization later. Keep gives me that. Its layout is hard to&#xA;browse and hasn&#39;t aged well visually, but it makes up for it with great search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on&#xA;shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform notes with rich text&#xA;support like headers, tables, monospaced text, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So where Keep is best used as a searchable cloud or swarm of notes, Notes is best used as&#xA;a curated and categorized filing cabinet. One note in Notes might be several dozen in&#xA;Keep, so the effort spent on curation is not so large, and neither is the impact of&#xA;only-okay search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But honestly neither of them is fantastic, and the choice between them is a wash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts, cross-app drag-and-drop, and &#34;quick notes&#34;&#xA;(make a note using an OS-universal gesture on macOS or iOS). I&#xA;use a shortcut to create a new note titled and sorted correctly before&#xA;starting a Chinese lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;byenotes&#34;&gt;Departure&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I switched off Apple Notes late 2022 because I&#xA;discovered the difficulty of getting notes out of it. There are third party&#xA;solutions that work okay, but the thought that Apple could break them at any moment&#xA;caused me to switch out of principle and fear. I exported what I could and started&#xA;looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My foray into Emacs had been happening in the background, so I tried&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;Org-mode&lt;/a&gt; and quickly became enamored. It took over&#xA;my notetaking duties because of how much its flexibility and breadth&#xA;dwarfed what I was used to. I never truly understood the adage &#34;Emacs is a great&#xA;operating system but lacks a good text editor&#34; until I tried Emacs + Org-mode. It&#39;s more&#xA;appropriate to draw comparisons between software suites (e.g. Google Workspace vs.&#xA;Microsoft Office vs. Emacs) than it is to compare it to other text editors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;!-- Maybe a good future blog post but doesn&#39;t belong on this page&#xA;Org files can in an instant become calendar&#xA;items, reminders, source code, web pages, anything. Source code blocks can be&#xA;evaluated. Todo lists can have&#xA;custom states per-file like `TODO`/`BLOCKED`/`KILLED`/ `DONE` in one and&#xA;`INVITED`/`ACCEPTED`/`DECLINED` in another. TODO item states&#xA;of course can be changed lexicographically, but also _logically_&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;Org understands them&#xA;and can remix them in any way. A few keystrokes (`C-c a t`) can collect TODOs&#xA;from all files and show them in one place (where you can still mark them off and persist&#xA;to the right file). Another can show them on a calendar according to due date.&#xA;&#xA;I expected Org-mode to be a syntax, but it&#39;s also the visual language that comes with&#xA;it. Note &#34;source code&#34; is plaintext, but Emacs can render the characters into UI as you type them, with no&#xA;separate render step or view, like how&#xA;ligatures work in code editors but with complexity reaching all the way to buttons,&#xA;checkboxes, input fields, and dropdowns, all usable with a mouse or keyboard.&#xA;&#xA;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;Blue text can be clicked to perform actions. Underlined text is links. The search box can be typed in.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;emacs&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of an Emacs help page that is clearly a text file, with line numbers and a cursor and all, but that also has interactive components like buttons, and links, and a search box rendered inline with the text. The interactive components still feel like they are rendered with basic unicode, as they are boxy without pretty gradients and such.&#34;&#xA;}}&#xA;&#xA;With the Emacs extensions ecosystem, you can even sychronize a lot of these features&#xA;with other tools like Google Calendar, Apple Reminders, etc.&#xA;--&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is still plagued by a lack of good mobile options. As well, after 12 years of Vim I know how much work I&#39;ll put into&#xA;achieving a perfect setup, and I just don&#39;t have it in me this time. As the years tick by,&#xA;the long-term benefits of that up-front investment tick down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; has been my saving grace, which is like Org-mode if it&#xA;were made twenty years later. Its plugin ecosystem handles 80% of the crazy things Org&#39;s&#xA;does for 20% of the hassle. Browsing Obsidian&#xA;plugins gives me the same feeling of wonder browsing &lt;a href=&#34;https://melpa.org/&#34;&gt;MELPA&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has a fantastic mobile experience and built-in sync of everything from notes to&#xA;preferences to plugins. Most importantly, it all &#34;just works&#34;. So I&#39;ve switched to&#xA;Obsidian as of March 2023 and haven&#39;t looked back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;reminders&#34;&gt;✔ Tasks → Reminders&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS. Reminders can be scheduled&#xA;to “pop” at a date, a date and time, a location, and/or when messaging&#xA;&lt;code&gt;$PERSON&lt;/code&gt;. Reminders can belong to lists (e.g. work vs. personal), lists can be&#xA;shared (e.g. family chores), and reminders within shared lists can be assigned&#xA;to people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders have a name, description, URL field, and priority (higher priority&#xA;reminders are sorted higher and given special UI treatment). Reminders can&#xA;have images attached to them, and any number of subtasks. They can be tagged&#xA;and flagged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful app, but everything is presented simply. There is a native&#xA;macOS app that synchronizes, so I get proper notifications on most of my&#xA;devices. In app, I use the “Today” view which shows reminders ready to be&#xA;addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one use case, Summer and I share a family reminders list. On that list, a&#xA;reminder to take out the trash pops every trash day when I arrive home. It’s&#xA;assigned to me, but if she happens to do it before I get home she can check it&#xA;off; it then won&#39;t pop for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share sheet in&#xA;native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in the URL field)&#xA;and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder (if any) on my Apple&#xA;Watch homescreen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;siri&#34;&gt;ⅹ Google Assistant → Siri&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can&#39;t answer questions&#xA;like &#34;What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?&#34; or &#34;Who played Alan in&#xA;Tron Legacy?&#34;. Its best uses are for deep integrations like setting reminders or alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Siri include surface-level interaction with native apps:&#xA;setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home devices, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;shortcuts&#34;&gt;✔ Google Assistant Routines → Shortcuts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most&#xA;power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had&#xA;around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it to shell&#xA;scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;I use Shortcuts.app to block times on my work calendar based on personal events.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;shortcuts&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of a shortcut on iOS&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one example, when I wrote in the iA Writer mobile app I would use Shortcuts to&#xA;automatically commit and push my writing to twos.dev daily. Because iA&#xA;Writer stores files in iCloud, and another iOS app called Working Copy can&#xA;interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Pull from &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; remote&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(iOS) Get contents of folder &lt;code&gt;iCloud/iA Writer/Published&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Write contents of folder to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twos.dev/winter&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./src/warm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Stage &lt;code&gt;./src/warm&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Commit &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; with message “Automatic commit by iA Writer&#xA;sync job”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Push &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; to remote&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could&#xA;do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say that my phone is&#xA;a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;drive&#34;&gt;⚠ Google Drive → iCloud Drive&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception. Use it&#xA;if you&#39;re in the Apple ecosystem, and don&#39;t if you&#39;re not. The biggest downside&#xA;I&#39;ve witnessed is that iCloud Drive does not have an API. This is not a problem&#xA;when running software on a persistent macOS or Windows machine, but for Linux or&#xA;for ephemeral machines (e.g. CI) the only option is an unofficial&#xA;reverse-engineered solution. This may be the reason I ultimately switch to&#xA;something else. I have been trying out Syncthing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow between&#xA;your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for first-party and&#xA;some third-party apps to use it as a default data store anyway (e.g. Pages&#xA;saves documents there, Numbers saves spreadsheets there).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS also pulls a trick where it invisibly queues up actions on iCloud Drive&#xA;files that haven&#39;t yet fully synced to your machine yet. For example, if you are&#xA;on your iPhone and download an image to iCloud Drive, then you open your Mac,&#xA;the image will show up ~immediately in macOS Finder, before it has finished&#xA;syncing. If you try to open the file in macOS before it finishes, the open&#xA;action will queue until the sync finishes, then execute. This behavior is nice&#xA;compared to the industry standard of trying to open a broken file, but when you&#xA;first encounter it with a large file like a video it&#39;s easy to perceive it as&#xA;OS-level slowness or stalling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;ⅹ YouTube Music → Apple Music&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:&#xA;services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified a lot&#xA;of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator workflow that&#xA;would move the cursor to my existing library, select and copy a title, then&#xA;move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and add the top result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with the&#xA;iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app. Navigation is&#xA;slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact that it takes too many&#xA;transitions to get where you’re going. For details on its UX failings, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem&#34;&gt;Jake&#xA;from Cinnamon&#39;s&#xA;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration, Spotlight integration, and better&#xA;Siri support for playing things handsfree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;byemusic&#34;&gt;Departure&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I miss Google Play Music, which solved all my problems. I&#39;ve softly switched to Spotify&#xA;which seems overall better, almost strictly so if it weren&#39;t for ecosystem effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;pay&#34;&gt;✔ Google Pay → Apple Pay&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me embarrassed to use&#xA;it. It was hard to find &#34;the spot&#34; on credit card machines to tap. Apple Pay&#xA;feels more spatially generous; once I start hunting for the spot, it&#39;s already&#xA;been found. It could be because the iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of&#xA;the device while Pixels have them in the middle, or maybe the world has just&#xA;gotten better at this since then. I&#39;m now using Apple Pay every chance I get.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the&#xA;purchases I make in Seattle, about 95% of shops and restaurants with counter pay&#xA;support Apple Pay, and about 20% of table-service restaurants&#xA;do. For online orders, roughly half of the non-Amazon orders I place support&#xA;it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first credit card&#xA;experience that feels like it was made this century. The app is beautiful,&#xA;snappy, and simple. The rewards (2% cashback on everything via Apple Pay, 1% on everything else) are good but beatable; several banks now have universal 2% cashback cards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video &#34;Drilling into Apple Card transactions using Wallet.&#34; &#34;card&#34; }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts&#34;&gt;✔ Google Podcasts → Apple Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google Podcasts and Apple Podcasts are very comparable. Google Podcasts has a&#xA;bit plainer UI, but they&#39;re both good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest upside to Apple Podcasts is the better sorting and filtering of&#xA;episodes on a podcast-specific basis. For example, I like Planet Money enough&#xA;that I want to listen to every episode, so I have them play from oldest to&#xA;newest; most other podcasts I don&#39;t care so much and have no hope of working&#xA;through their backlogs, so I go newest to oldest. These all interleave&#xA;correctly when I hit the podcast-agnostic &#34;Play&#34; button on the homescreen, so&#xA;that the correct episodes of each podcast are played.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest downside to Apple Podcasts has been stability. Roughly 1-5% of&#xA;the time I go to play a podcast, the player gets stuck loading it forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Podcasts include tight Siri support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a living document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the sum of&#xA;its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned is that it’s&#xA;the long tail of ecosystem benefits that makes up most of that excess. Not the&#xA;two or three things per product I’ve mentioned above, but the dozens that&#xA;happen without me noticing that add up to make a more enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are functional&#xA;benefits to working in a clean space&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it’s easier to find things, spilling a&#xA;liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less dust&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;but the bulk of the&#xA;benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways the space feels better and motivates&#xA;more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would not count&#xA;it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell and I&#39;ll continue&#xA;to document my journey here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

</body></html><h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>My life is in Google more than anyone I know. The usual suspects sure<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Gmail,
Photos, Chrome, etc.<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>but also the ones people stay away from<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Tasks, Keep,
YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We
have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook,
the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the
“Google graveyard”. And for a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture
with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it's no surprise I’ve
been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.</p>

<p>But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is
how I understand why<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>or whether<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I prefer what I chose. For Android, that
means trialing an iPhone. <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&amp;t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw">I did
this</a>
five years ago for a few months (thanks <a href="https://bensw.com">bensw</a>), but
afterwards I thought "It's actually not that different, it's just that the
Google apps don't feel native, so I’ll stick with Android".</p>

<p>Since then, I've realized it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition
without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the same reason Google apps
don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn't shine if you only use Google apps.</p>

<p>So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an honest,
holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me out, but better to
trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know
one. These are my notes on hopping the fence.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Broad Themes</h2>

<p>Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I'll summarize
the themes I've witnessed during them.</p>

<h3 id="safety">Safety vs. Freedom</h3>

<p>In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I'd long ago published its
Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding denial after denial.
I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user, and I could see with fresh
eyes the effects of the strictness.</p>

<p>Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating system. They
don't feel like they were written by others, and that makes me feel safe. My
data feels like part of my device, not part of Google. And I trust my device
to manage my payment, location, etc. data, because it is mine. I own it.</p>

<p>That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight for it.
But it's a good feeling. And it only comes with control<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>control by a
representative I trust, over parties I don't. I don't know app developers,
especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through them I can trust app
developers, but only because Apple so heavily controls what they can publish.
They can't send me to their sketchy site or use dark patterns to trick me into
paying them.</p>

<p>Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don't feel safe, I have
the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I have "the choice" to do
a food safety inspection of every restaurant I visit, but I do not want to and
I wouldn't know what I'm looking for, so I trust my local health department. This allows me to visit any restaurant stress-free, without food safety taking up space in my brain.</p>

<p>For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go through
the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means Apple takes a cut
of everything. As a user, this means one central place where I can manage
(read: cancel) subscriptions<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>no digging through menus or talking to customer
service agents.</p>

<p>{{ imgs
   "The App Store's subscriptions management menus."
   "subscriptions"
   "Screenshot of iOS App Store showing multiple active subscriptions"
   "subscription"
   "iOS App Store showing options to change or cancel a subscription"
}}</p>

<p>Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party auth
providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means building
another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this means I get a native,
one-tap, FaceID sign-in.</p>

<p>{{ video "Signing in with Apple." "signin" }}</p>

<p>These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see the more
I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing "public goods",
whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad clickthrough<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>data, eyeballs,
and engagement. Of course, this has its problems. Apple is a private company,
not elected officials, so is only as beholden to its end users as it wants to
be. For now, the incentives seem aligned.</p>

<h3 id="offline">Offline-first vs. Online-first Design</h3>

<p>Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in attitude
Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user identity. To
Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is just a window into that
account. The device may have some caching and synchronization to remain useful
offline, but ultimately Google's servers are the source of truth.</p>

<p>To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data between
multiple devices, but it's just that<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>synchronization. Apps usually wait until
the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you can even still perform a
first-class OS-level sync of all your data to another device with a cable
instead of iCloud. You can also opt to keep everything local.</p>

<p>Here are some ways these differences are expressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google wants a blurry line between web and native experiences; its official
apps are going the way of PWAs and similar tech that can be deployed to web
and app ~identically. In contrast Apple puts every major UX flow in a native
app, from email and calendar to bug reporting and account management. Even
uploading apps to the App Store for publishing<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a fundamentally online
experience<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>is a native macOS app.</li>
<li>Google Docs documents are rows in a database. Apple Pages documents are files
on a filesystem.</li>
<li>When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a phone
number or email), not an Apple account<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>even if the bubble is blue. You may
even be unknowingly using a combination of phone and email for one contact,
because iMessage silently interleaves them if they're owned by the same Apple
account. If that person later removes one from their Apple account, your
iMessage thread with them retroactively splits.</li>
<li>In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call from your
computer, you're going through Google's servers. In the Apple ecosystem,
when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad, you're connecting
locally to your iPhone to route the call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic
always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly
experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a machine
are centralized in iCloud settings where they're often off by default. I still
can't get one of my Safaris to synchronize its bookmarks with the rest.</p>

<h3 id="committment">Commitment vs. Experimentation</h3>

<p>Google is infamous for killing products. They release early, often, and in
isolation; see Hangouts and Allo, Meet and Duo, or Reminders and Tasks.
Innovation comes first and stablizing the product offering comes second, when
the product is proven (or not proven) to work.</p>

<p>Apple instead takes the "measure twice, cut once" approach; products are
rarely released and rarely killed. The iPod was around for 21 years,
co-existing with the iPhone for 12 of them. Apple Maps was a notoriously
failed app at launch in 2012 and still suffers from that reputational injury,
however <em>it's still around anyway</em> and has improved drastically (although
whether enough is <a href="#maps">still in question</a>).</p>

<p>Google's reputation for killing products causes a negative feedback loop. When
Google releases a product that relies on market buy-in<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>say, a watch OS (needs
app developer buy-in) or a chat app (needs consumer buy-in)<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it's an uphill
battle to get the market on board, because it knows Google may turn around and
kill the product anyway. This lack of buy-in seals the product's fate, and it
goes to the graveyard.</p>

<p>In contrast, Apple's reputation for <em>not</em> killing products causes the market to
embrace it with open arms, kicking off a positive feedback loop that ensures its
success. iPad needed developers to design for a different form factor to be
successful, and they did. Apple Watch needed developers to design watch flows
for their app to be successful, and they did.</p>

<p>There are more factors at play than reputation, like developer experience and
user experience, but the point stands<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a reputation for killing products
contributes to more product deaths.</p>

<h2 id="specifics">Specific Notes</h2>

<p>Below are my notes on moving between the ecosystems at specific touchpoints. To
see an overview, visit the <a href="#toc">table of contents</a>.</p>

<h3 id="key">Key</h3>

<p>✔ = Switch successful; happily using Apple product</p>

<p>ⅹ = Switch unsuccessful; moved back to Google or to another product</p>

<p>⚠ = Nuance ahead</p>

<h3 id="macos">✔ ArchLinux → macOS</h3>

<p>I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a decade,
so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass migration. I grew up
gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for development due to a love of the
POSIX command line and the simplicity of the system. I found macOS to scratch
the same itches without the days spent customizing and debugging things.</p>

<p>Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use to
apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and, including taps, a
breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it) the AUR. It also bundles its
own service management, e.g.
<code>brew services start postgresql</code>.</p>

<p>TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between Windows
security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It's good enough that it
stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I'll have to type my password
to unlock 1Password here and there.</p>

<p>The app ethos on macOS is that all apps are self-contained <code>.app</code> files, and
uninstalling an app is defined as <code>rm</code>ing that file. It's spoiled me to
hesitation when I encounter the rare app that needs an installer.</p>

<p>Roughly half the apps I use are available on the macOS App Store. For apps it
manages, it handles updates, payments, and even
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting_app_store_reviews">prompts for
review</a>.
I generally look there first when searching for an app, then Homebrew (if I know
what I'm looking for), then Google.</p>

<h3 id="ipad">✔ Nexus 7 → iPad</h3>

<p>My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it should
give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.</p>

<p>When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user to be
using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the
tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually worse than using the
same app on my phone. I expected a more polished but overall similar
experience from iPad.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some light
computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the form factor; apps
use it to display more and differently laid out information. Generally, the
extra horizontal space is used to persistently display a nav menu or the
previous screen.</p>

<p>{{ imgs
   "Wikipedia on iPhone vs. iPad."
   "iphone"
   "A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPhone"
   "ipad"
   "A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPad, using extra space for navigation"
}}</p>

<p>A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw this as a
marketing move, but I've learned they really did push the needle more in the
direction of general-purpose computing. The three features that did it for me
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple windows for one app</li>
<li>Files app</li>
<li>Better multitasking</li>
</ul>

<p>Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but being able
to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply feels great.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second monitor, and
the ability to use my Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control the iPad. macOS’s
Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input device for signing documents
and marking up images. This is something I did before by manually transferring
files, but now it’s two clicks with instant sync.</p>

<h3 id="iphone">✔ Pixel → iPhone</h3>

<p>I was initially surprised iPhone and iPad lack feature parity. This first came
up trying to swipe-type on iPad. Another is iPad can show multiple apps on the
screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay. I felt
confused at first, but I see Apple’s angle<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>none of these quite make sense on
the other form factor. They’d rather deny you the feature than allow using it to
be confusing or unintuitive. Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad
because Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.</p>

<p>The more native apps I use on iOS, the better the UX gets. For example, you
can use multi-touch to drag-and-drop items between apps. Third-party apps only
implement this functionality sometimes.</p>

<p>{{ videos
"Using multi-touch to drag and drop items between apps."
"drag-photos"
"drag-text"
}}</p>

<p>FaceID is about on par with fingerprint unlock on Pixel. They each encounter
their own situational troubles, but both are great overall and I'm no more or
less happy.</p>

<h4 id="fi">Google Fi</h4>

<p>When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier. We
decided to stay with it because they'd recently started to officially support
iPhone. However, after about a year we found out that Google Fi had been
intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages from iPhones, leading one friend
(I hope only one) and I to think we were ghosting each other. Once I learned
this, Summer and I immediately switched off Google Fi to T-Mobile, which had a
close ethical alignment around contracts and data usage.</p>

<p>Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I can't
see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and long-term bug that
was never even communicated.</p>

<h4 id="notifications">Notifications</h4>

<p>Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference
makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call them a sidegrade.</p>

<p>Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on
your phone then read that email on any platform, the notification goes away.
Otherwise, the notification will be there even days later. In this way,
Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.</p>

<p>iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the notification is
(usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the phone is unlocked the
notification moves to a secondary location “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen.
I do inbox zero, so this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications
by committing the cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.</p>

<p>However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers in the
corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android notifications
are, so can be used as a todo list. They're a decent enough substitute that
although I still prefer Android’s notifications, the difference is a couple of
orders of magnitude less impactful than I scoped it out as.</p>

<h4 id="imessage">iMessage</h4>

<p>I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about
“solving” mobile chat<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it’s been solved for them for years. iMessage is the
gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the guilty urge to nudge friends
towards iPhone so I can use it with them.</p>

<p>To users iMessage threads appear to be between contacts, but on the backend
they're between contact methods like phone numbers or email addresses. Along
with Apple's device-first philosophy I presume this is so people don't need an
Apple account to use iMessage, but it has quite a few papercuts. I recently
changed my email address but I need to keep my old one in my Apple account
indefinitely so my friends’ threads with me (read: with my old email address)
won’t retroactively split. I've also encountered unsolvable problems spinning up
group chats with <a href="https://jm.dev">Jordan</a> since he switched to a Japanese phone number.</p>

<p>Beyond these rare issues I'm very happy with iMessage.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iMessage include rich embedded media from all other Apple
products like Photos, Music, and Maps, and automatically entering SMS 2FA codes
on any device.</p>

<p>{{ img

   "Screenshot of a 2FA prompt suggesting an auto-fill from iMessage"
}}</p>

<h3 id="watch">✔ Moto 360 → Apple Watch</h3>

<p>My relationship with the Moto 360 was on and off. To me it served two
functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let me check the time without taking out my phone</li>
<li>Let me check a notification without taking out my phone</li>
</ul>

<p>These were helpful functions, but the work of managing an extra battery to
charge and an extra device to put on and take off made me fluctuate every six
months or so between wearing it every day and not wearing it at all.</p>

<p>Apple Watch adds enough bullet points that I've had no such fluctuations<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I
wear it daily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlock macOS/iOS when nearby, in lieu of entering a password/passcode</li>
<li>Vibrate in patterns for Apple Maps navigation directions (e.g. one pattern
for upcoming left, another for upcoming right)</li>
<li>Pay using Apple Pay by tapping</li>
<li>Shazam a song without taking out your phone</li>
<li>Show popped reminders or upcoming calendar events on the watch face</li>
<li>Control Keynote presentations (e.g. tap for next slide)</li>
<li>View your phone's camera viewfinder live and tap to snap (e.g. for group
photos)</li>
<li>Control media playback</li>
<li>"Walkie-talkie" with a close friend</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the above, the third-party app ecosystem plays ball with Apple
Watch a lot more than the Android app ecosystem does with Wear OS.</p>

<h3 id="appletv">✔ Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV</h3>

<p>We don’t have HomePods and Summer forbids me to get any (reasonably) after
filling our home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey
Google, play <code>$SHOW</code>”.</p>

<p>When it comes to casting from your phone Apple TV and Chromecast are both good,
but Chromecast shines brighter. Casting is a first-class citizen on Chromecast
because it's all you have. I've seen more apps expose a Chromecast icon than an
AirPlay icon, and casting to an Apple TV that's asleep sometimes just turns it
on without playing anything. We now just use the remote as our default control
mechanism.</p>

<h4 id="remote">The Remote</h4>

<p>Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that it's
pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use;
I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Otherwise it has a good build quality. It's not IR,
so you don't have to point it at anything. Because the Apple TV can forward
incoming buttonpresses to the attached television, it's a strict upgrade even for television controls
like volume adjustment. But it’s a remote, and can
be lost or have sticky liquids spiked into it like any other. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that keeps it on the side of the coffee table. I
miss the remote-free life.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is selected on
the Apple TV, a notification shows on my iOS devices allowing me to use them
as a keyboard. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for
invoking 1Password to fill logins.</p>

<h3 id="home">✔ Google Home → Apple Home</h3>

<p>My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent building up
our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a Raspberry Pi made it all
work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV showing our Nest doorbell camera
picture-in-picture when the doorbell rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a
Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home Hub.)</p>

<p>The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list that
feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a breeze.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT gateway,
having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center pull-down menus, and
hooking up more devices through automation with Shortcuts.</p>

<h3 id="airpods">✔ Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro</h3>

<p>Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true.
Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my
ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs, even for flights.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775">Spatial audio</a> is literally too good;
I had to turn it off. Again and again I became very nervous that I was blasting
sound from my speakers, so I would have to briefly remove one earbud to ensure
I wasn't. The anxiety of this was so distracting as to be counterproductive.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between devices based
on attention, a Siri integration slightly worse than Pixel Buds's Google
Assistant integration, and spatial audio.</p>

<h3 id="mail">⚠ Gmail → iCloud Mail</h3>

<p>The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I control
anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.</p>

<h4 id="migrating">Migrating Emails</h4>

<p>I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the experience
was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired result. After
starting from scratch several times and hitting new issues every time, I’ve
chosen to live the life of searching in two places when I need something.</p>

<h4 id="migratingaddresses">Migrating Email Addresses</h4>

<p>To migrate email addresses I made a very tough decision that I'm still
frustrated years later that I had to make, which was to change Google accounts
during the transition. To use iCloud Mail means I can't use <code>@gmail.com</code>, and
I've been wanting to migrate to a domain I control anyway.</p>

<p>But I wanted my email address on my Google account to match
my true email address, and Google doesn't let you change your primary email
address. You can add additional "contact" email addresses, but your account is
still very much bound to the original address you signed up for. If you try to
do this anyway, like I did, there are a lot of little knock-on effects.</p>

<p>One is that accepting calendar invitations adds your Google account as an
invitee to the event (confusing the organizer, who won't recognize it). And
because your Google account wasn't invited by the organizer, joining Meet
meetings means you first get dumped into a waiting room from which the
organizer has to approve you. This is especially frustrating when the
organizer doesn't show up, but the meeting is still happening.</p>

<p>Google Groups also behaves poorly, as you'll get added to groups by your true
email address but you'll join as a Google account, forcing your web-based
replies to be from your Google account's email address.</p>

<p>In my first effort to migrate Google accounts, I coopted ben@twos.dev from
Google Workspace which I had used for a little consulting. This caused a
few minor issues and UX hiccups because Workspace Gmail believed it was
still my provider, even though a non-Gmail server was receiving my emails.</p>

<p>I tried to use this Google Workspace account as my new primary Google account.
But many Google features don't support Workspace accounts, like Google One,
family sharing, some security features, and (for better and worse) some types
of data harvesting and therefore ad/search targeting.</p>

<p>I've now landed on creating a new personal Google account with ben@twos.dev as
its primary email address. I needed to delete the twos.dev Google Workspace
organization to do this, as it had claim to ben@twos.dev already. Signing up
to Google without an <code>@gmail.com</code> address is a somewhat hidden option, but it
exists. You just can't ever fall into their "upgrade" funnel which assigns you
an <code>@gmail.com</code> address, because that <em>does</em> change your primary email address
and there's no way back.</p>

<p>None of this would be so frustrating if there weren't so many things tied to my
Google account, like all my Maps reviews, my Chat/Hangouts history from decades
ago, and my purchased Play content. I really wanted to keep my account, but
there's just no way to do that with a new email address without experiencing too
many little hiccups to be worth it. The one thing I could smoothly transfer over
was YouTube. Everything else was surprisingly as "walled garden" as you'd expect
from an Apple product, just in subtler ways.</p>

<h4 id="daily">Daily Use</h4>

<p>The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve installed
Thunderbird to get by.</p>

<p>Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and has a
solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability issues:</p>

<p>Mail's junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk folder,
even after months of correcting it.</p>

<p>When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud Drive links
instead (Google has this same behavior with Drive), but I've had recipients experience trouble downloading them.</p>

<p>Mail's search is bad. On macOS, it searches only the mailbox being viewed
(e.g. Inbox) by default. Because I do inbox zero, this is never what I want to
search. (iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by default.) When you are
done searching and click Inbox to "return home" the search field doesn't
clear, leading you to believe your Inbox is empty.</p>

<p>Ignoring that, Gmail still wins search by an order of magnitude. For example,
Gmail searches the contents of PDFs attached to emails; I’ve found this
invaluable finding old leases and whatnot.</p>

<p>Mail is below average at threading emails:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once in a while, it omits an email from a thread that it shouldn’t have.</li>
<li>When replying to a thread, the sent email doesn't appear immediately in the local
view, which makes it seem like something has gone wrong with the sending.</li>
<li>When marking a thread as "Notify" (a nice feature which forces updates to the thread
to send a push notification even when they're off), emails sent into the thread by you
trigger the push. Even emails from the same platform and app that is in charge of
notifying.</li>
</ul>

<p>I experience long, uncollapsible nested quotes in some threads, where
Gmail was always good at collapsing them automatically.</p>

<p>Mail is bad at converting text to rich text. For example, it will not automatically
convert markdown-esque lists (e.g. <code>1. Some text</code> or <code>- Some text</code>) to rich text lists.</p>

<p>macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service has a
separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have disparate
feature sets and don't synchronize. iOS Mail does not support filters. I’ve
opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because the iCloud filters can only
check one condition per filter, and I just have my iMac stay awake 24/7.</p>

<p>macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to archive.
Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for any app.</p>

<p>{{ img
   "Any app's menu actions (e.g. File → Save) can be [re]bound."
   "rebind"
   "A screenshot of macOS's Settings.app rebinding a key for Mail.app"
}}</p>

<p>If you want a Mail-like experience with Gmail as a backend, instead of using
SMTP I recommend <a href="https://mimestream.com">Mimestream</a>; it is written by a former
Apple Mail engineer to have a similar UX but using proper Gmail APIs.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in Spotlight
and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.</p>

<h3 id="calendar">⚠ Google Calendar → Apple Calendar</h3>

<p>I switched to Apple Calendar as both an app and a calendar provider. I'd
forgotten how limited and finicky calendar protocols are at their core<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>so many
things just stop working when you leave Google Calendar. Folks send me
invitations that don't show, my RSVPs don't make it back to them, and I
sometimes don't receive updates to events. Even unfurling invited mailing lists
into individuals (who can then RSVP individuallly) is specific to Google
Calendar.</p>

<p>I switched my provider back to Google Calendar about 18 months in while
continuing to use the Apple Calendar app. It's a much better experience while
sacrificing virtually nothing in ecosystem benefits. I also get to avoid the
crappy Apple Calendar web UI those few times I need my calendar on Windows, and
I get the more powerful sharing / RSVP tools of Google Calendar.</p>

<p>As for the Apple Calendar iOS and macOS apps, I don't recommend using the Week
view. Like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to
represent the current time of day; but this bar extends 100% of the width of the
week, and does not do a good job showing you which day today is.</p>

<p>{{ img
   "Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it is?"
   "calendar"
   "A screenshot of Calendar.app on macOS showing a week with a red line across it."
}}</p>

<p>This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing panic
about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar only shows
when viewing today.</p>

<p>Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say they
appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a calendar invitation
there are two attachments, <code>invite.ics</code> and <code>mime-attachment.ics</code>. Each will pop
up a Calendar float to add the event. I don't know the difference; since
switching to Google Calendar as a backend I've learned to RSVP using the
embedded buttons which (outside of Gmail) open a web browser to the Google
Calendar UI.</p>

<p>{{ video
  "Opening a Google Calendar invitation from within the Apple ecosystem."
  "mail"
}}</p>

<p>Apple Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed to
have a refresh in a decade. Apple Calendar can automatically generate “travel
to” and “travel from” events based on the travel time between locations.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps, Siri suggestions
for navigation destinations and video calls, and the ability to longpress dates and times in iMessage to create events.</p>

<h3 id="maps">⚠ Google Maps → Apple Maps</h3>

<p>Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly so. But
that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved. Unfortunately it’s
only gotten good, not great.</p>

<p>There are UX benefits over Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past
this light, then at the next one, turn <code>$DIRECTION</code>”, but about 5% of my trips
to new places end me at the right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been
routed to the delivery entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an airport,
and the wrong parking lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) for a store in a large
shopping center.</p>

<p>Then there's the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos, menus,
ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here; their purchase
of Yelp means they inherit photos &amp; reviews, but even that can't beat the
sheer volume Google Maps. I've only seen one or two restaurants with ordering
functionality enabled. Many business hours are out of date<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I update them when I
notice, but I'm just one person.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and Calendar,
Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other sources, and Apple
Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming turns.</p>

<h4 id="byemaps">Departure</h4>

<p>I’d like to continue to give Apple Maps chances because I know more data helps, but for tight
schedules I wouldn't chance it. Incidentally, we purchased a Polestar which has Google
Maps built right into it, so I've begun to softly switch back to that even on my other
devices simply for the cross-integration.</p>

<h4 id="findmy">✔ Location Sharing → Find My</h4>

<p>I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends and
family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple offering (a
separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one would be happy with
the other.</p>

<p>I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must launch
with intention, but it's a wash for me<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>I've had serendipitous encounters
enabled by seeing a friend is close by in Google Maps accidentally.</p>

<p>AirTags and device tracking are the big Apple killer feature here, which work
as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one in my bag just to
have peace of mind. The app sends a notification when I leave <code>$DEVICE</code> at
<code>$LOCATION</code>, with easy controls to disable future notifications for any such
combination.</p>

<h3 id="photos">✔ Google Photos → Apple Photos</h3>

<p>Mostly, these two products are equivalent. Apple Photos has more powerful
editing tools but Google Photos has more powerful search. Both have similar
tooling around memories, viewing photos on maps or by year, etc.</p>

<p>Classically, Google has a better web experience and Apple has a better native
experience, meaning sharing photos with others is better in Apple Photos if and
only if you're sharing with other Apple users.</p>

<p>As I've been getting more into photography I've come to like how smooth the
import experience is in macOS<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>insert SD card, Photos.app automatically opens up
to the Import window, I tick "Automatically delete photos after import" and tell
it go, and it's done. I can take the SD card out and the photos will upload in
the background. The Google equivalent isn't <em>hard</em> but it takes more
babysitting.</p>

<p>The migration from Google Photos to Apple Photos was simple, but long. Google
Takeout produced hundreds of gigabytes of exports, which I downloaded onto a Mac
and then imported with Photos.app. Due to Apple's offline-first approach
synchronization took place in the background at reduced speeds. This meant it
tried to take place while the laptop was closed and charging. This was jarring
at first when trying to babysit the process, as by design it stops performing
well when you start using the machine. When I learned to let go, it showed its
colors.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects include rich embeds &amp; commenting in iMessage, and photos
appearing in upload prompts on all platforms (e.g. when uploading an avatar to
some random internet account) with full face search embedded.</p>

<h3 id="safari">⚠ Chrome → Safari</h3>

<p>This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from
bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.</p>

<p>In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the Chrome
chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone applications even
when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go backward or forward slides
the page on/off screen allowing you to peek without navigating, but it
backfires and feels artificial for low-travel anchor links and some
single-page app transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the
navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can't
identify.</p>

<p>When it works it's beautiful and useful, but when it doesn't it's jarring.</p>

<p>{{ video "Navigating through history in Safari with swipe gestures." "back"}}</p>

<p>I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced some
webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others (local only); Meet also supports
more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one tab.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff (move a browsing session between
devices smoothly) and the downright bonkers power efficiency of Safari on macOS.</p>

<h4 id="keychain">ⅹ iCloud Keychain</h4>

<p>While moving to Safari, I replaced 1Password with iCloud Keychain. It serves
basic needs, but that’s it. It can store a username, a password, a 2FA code,
and a domain name for each entry.</p>

<p>It cannot store two domains for one entry, e.g. gmail.com and google.com. It
cannot store arbitrary notes on an entry, e.g. the PIN that T-Mobile customer
service agents ask for. It cannot name an entry, e.g. Washington Corporations
and Charities System instead of ccfs.sos.wa.gov. It cannot store non-login
entries like documents, ID numbers, or insurance information.</p>

<p>Using the 2FA field involves manual effort. Scanning rarely works, so I enter
the 2FA secret by copying and pasting the code. Some sites provide a raw code,
while others wrap the code in a URL that contains other metadata. 1Password
accepts either, but iCloud Keychain assumes you hand it a code; if you hand it
a URL it will silently accept it but produce incorrect codes.</p>

<p>I moved back to 1Password.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include faster and more fluid autofill
support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS.</p>

<h3 id="numbers">✔ Google Sheets → Numbers</h3>

<p>As a casual spreadsheets user, Sheets and Numbers are nearly identical.
Numbers has nicer UX when editing formulae that visualizes cell(s) being
referenced. It tries to humanize references, e.g. “Ben age” for a cell in a
row with header “Ben” and a column with header “Age”, instead of A:123. This
is nice until headers get long and multiworded. Overall it’s a wash.</p>

<p>However, there's obviously a real social benefit to using Google Sheets if you have need of
sharing them.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Numbers include Spotlight integration for quickly opening a sheet.</p>

<!--
### Google Docs → Pages {#pages}

(To be filled in; I have not had much Pages experience.)
-->

<h3 id="notes">ⅹ Keep → Apple Notes</h3>

<p>I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>get out of my way and let me
write. Let me deal with organization later. Keep gives me that. Its layout is hard to
browse and hasn't aged well visually, but it makes up for it with great search.</p>

<p>Apple Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on
shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform notes with rich text
support like headers, tables, monospaced text, etc.</p>

<p>So where Keep is best used as a searchable cloud or swarm of notes, Notes is best used as
a curated and categorized filing cabinet. One note in Notes might be several dozen in
Keep, so the effort spent on curation is not so large, and neither is the impact of
only-okay search.</p>

<p>But honestly neither of them is fantastic, and the choice between them is a wash.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts, cross-app drag-and-drop, and "quick notes"
(make a note using an OS-universal gesture on macOS or iOS). I
use a shortcut to create a new note titled and sorted correctly before
starting a Chinese lesson.</p>

<h4 id="byenotes">Departure</h4>

<p>I switched off Apple Notes late 2022 because I
discovered the difficulty of getting notes out of it. There are third party
solutions that work okay, but the thought that Apple could break them at any moment
caused me to switch out of principle and fear. I exported what I could and started
looking for alternatives.</p>

<p>My foray into Emacs had been happening in the background, so I tried
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> and quickly became enamored. It took over
my notetaking duties because of how much its flexibility and breadth
dwarfed what I was used to. I never truly understood the adage "Emacs is a great
operating system but lacks a good text editor" until I tried Emacs + Org-mode. It's more
appropriate to draw comparisons between software suites (e.g. Google Workspace vs.
Microsoft Office vs. Emacs) than it is to compare it to other text editors.</p>

<!-- Maybe a good future blog post but doesn't belong on this page
Org files can in an instant become calendar
items, reminders, source code, web pages, anything. Source code blocks can be
evaluated. Todo lists can have
custom states per-file like `TODO`/`BLOCKED`/`KILLED`/ `DONE` in one and
`INVITED`/`ACCEPTED`/`DECLINED` in another. TODO item states
of course can be changed lexicographically, but also _logically_<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>Org understands them
and can remix them in any way. A few keystrokes (`C-c a t`) can collect TODOs
from all files and show them in one place (where you can still mark them off and persist
to the right file). Another can show them on a calendar according to due date.

I expected Org-mode to be a syntax, but it's also the visual language that comes with
it. Note "source code" is plaintext, but Emacs can render the characters into UI as you type them, with no
separate render step or view, like how
ligatures work in code editors but with complexity reaching all the way to buttons,
checkboxes, input fields, and dropdowns, all usable with a mouse or keyboard.

{{ img

}}

With the Emacs extensions ecosystem, you can even sychronize a lot of these features
with other tools like Google Calendar, Apple Reminders, etc.
-->

<p>However, it is still plagued by a lack of good mobile options. As well, after 12 years of Vim I know how much work I'll put into
achieving a perfect setup, and I just don't have it in me this time. As the years tick by,
the long-term benefits of that up-front investment tick down.</p>

<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> has been my saving grace, which is like Org-mode if it
were made twenty years later. Its plugin ecosystem handles 80% of the crazy things Org's
does for 20% of the hassle. Browsing Obsidian
plugins gives me the same feeling of wonder browsing <a href="https://melpa.org/">MELPA</a>
did.</p>

<p>It has a fantastic mobile experience and built-in sync of everything from notes to
preferences to plugins. Most importantly, it all "just works". So I've switched to
Obsidian as of March 2023 and haven't looked back.</p>

<h3 id="reminders">✔ Tasks → Reminders</h3>

<p>Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS. Reminders can be scheduled
to “pop” at a date, a date and time, a location, and/or when messaging
<code>$PERSON</code>. Reminders can belong to lists (e.g. work vs. personal), lists can be
shared (e.g. family chores), and reminders within shared lists can be assigned
to people.</p>

<p>Reminders have a name, description, URL field, and priority (higher priority
reminders are sorted higher and given special UI treatment). Reminders can
have images attached to them, and any number of subtasks. They can be tagged
and flagged.</p>

<p>It’s a powerful app, but everything is presented simply. There is a native
macOS app that synchronizes, so I get proper notifications on most of my
devices. In app, I use the “Today” view which shows reminders ready to be
addressed.</p>

<p>As one use case, Summer and I share a family reminders list. On that list, a
reminder to take out the trash pops every trash day when I arrive home. It’s
assigned to me, but if she happens to do it before I get home she can check it
off; it then won't pop for me.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share sheet in
native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in the URL field)
and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder (if any) on my Apple
Watch homescreen.</p>

<h3 id="siri">ⅹ Google Assistant → Siri</h3>

<p>Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can't answer questions
like "What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?" or "Who played Alan in
Tron Legacy?". Its best uses are for deep integrations like setting reminders or alarms.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Siri include surface-level interaction with native apps:
setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home devices, etc.</p>

<h3 id="shortcuts">✔ Google Assistant Routines → Shortcuts</h3>

<p>I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most
power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had
around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it to shell
scripts.</p>

<p>{{ img
   "I use Shortcuts.app to block times on my work calendar based on personal events."
   "shortcuts"
   "A screenshot of a shortcut on iOS"
}}</p>

<p>As one example, when I wrote in the iA Writer mobile app I would use Shortcuts to
automatically commit and push my writing to twos.dev daily. Because iA
Writer stores files in iCloud, and another iOS app called Working Copy can
interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Working Copy) Pull from <code>twos.dev</code> remote</li>
<li>(iOS) Get contents of folder <code>iCloud/iA Writer/Published</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Write contents of folder to <a href="https://twos.dev/winter"><code>./src/warm</code></a> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Stage <code>./src/warm</code> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Commit <code>twos.dev</code> with message “Automatic commit by iA Writer
sync job”</li>
<li>(Working Copy) Push <code>twos.dev</code> to remote</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could
do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say that my phone is
a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="drive">⚠ Google Drive → iCloud Drive</h3>

<p>Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception. Use it
if you're in the Apple ecosystem, and don't if you're not. The biggest downside
I've witnessed is that iCloud Drive does not have an API. This is not a problem
when running software on a persistent macOS or Windows machine, but for Linux or
for ephemeral machines (e.g. CI) the only option is an unofficial
reverse-engineered solution. This may be the reason I ultimately switch to
something else. I have been trying out Syncthing.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow between
your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for first-party and
some third-party apps to use it as a default data store anyway (e.g. Pages
saves documents there, Numbers saves spreadsheets there).</p>

<p>macOS also pulls a trick where it invisibly queues up actions on iCloud Drive
files that haven't yet fully synced to your machine yet. For example, if you are
on your iPhone and download an image to iCloud Drive, then you open your Mac,
the image will show up ~immediately in macOS Finder, before it has finished
syncing. If you try to open the file in macOS before it finishes, the open
action will queue until the sync finishes, then execute. This behavior is nice
compared to the industry standard of trying to open a broken file, but when you
first encounter it with a large file like a video it's easy to perceive it as
OS-level slowness or stalling.</p>

<h3 id="music">ⅹ YouTube Music → Apple Music</h3>

<p>Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:
services.</p>

<p>Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified a lot
of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator workflow that
would move the cursor to my existing library, select and copy a title, then
move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and add the top result.</p>

<p>The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with the
iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app. Navigation is
slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact that it takes too many
transitions to get where you’re going. For details on its UX failings, see <a href="https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem">Jake
from Cinnamon's
post</a>.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration, Spotlight integration, and better
Siri support for playing things handsfree.</p>

<h4 id="byemusic">Departure</h4>

<p>I miss Google Play Music, which solved all my problems. I've softly switched to Spotify
which seems overall better, almost strictly so if it weren't for ecosystem effects.</p>

<h3 id="pay">✔ Google Pay → Apple Pay</h3>

<p>I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me embarrassed to use
it. It was hard to find "the spot" on credit card machines to tap. Apple Pay
feels more spatially generous; once I start hunting for the spot, it's already
been found. It could be because the iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of
the device while Pixels have them in the middle, or maybe the world has just
gotten better at this since then. I'm now using Apple Pay every chance I get.</p>

<p>Of the
purchases I make in Seattle, about 95% of shops and restaurants with counter pay
support Apple Pay, and about 20% of table-service restaurants
do. For online orders, roughly half of the non-Amazon orders I place support
it.</p>

<p>The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first credit card
experience that feels like it was made this century. The app is beautiful,
snappy, and simple. The rewards (2% cashback on everything via Apple Pay, 1% on everything else) are good but beatable; several banks now have universal 2% cashback cards.</p>

<h3 id="podcasts">✔ Google Podcasts → Apple Podcasts</h3>

<p>Google Podcasts and Apple Podcasts are very comparable. Google Podcasts has a
bit plainer UI, but they're both good enough.</p>

<p>The biggest upside to Apple Podcasts is the better sorting and filtering of
episodes on a podcast-specific basis. For example, I like Planet Money enough
that I want to listen to every episode, so I have them play from oldest to
newest; most other podcasts I don't care so much and have no hope of working
through their backlogs, so I go newest to oldest. These all interleave
correctly when I hit the podcast-agnostic "Play" button on the homescreen, so
that the correct episodes of each podcast are played.</p>

<p>The biggest downside to Apple Podcasts has been stability. Roughly 1-5% of
the time I go to play a podcast, the player gets stuck loading it forever.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Podcasts include tight Siri support.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a living document.</p>

<p>Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the sum of
its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned is that it’s
the long tail of ecosystem benefits that makes up most of that excess. Not the
two or three things per product I’ve mentioned above, but the dozens that
happen without me noticing that add up to make a more enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are functional
benefits to working in a clean space<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it’s easier to find things, spilling a
liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less dust<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>but the bulk of the
benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways the space feels better and motivates
more.</p>

<p>For now, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would not count
it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell and I'll continue
to document my journey here.</p>

But that word, &#34;spectrum&#34;, in that&#xA;  context, has had its meaning lost to time.

This is how to actually think&#xA;  about the autism spectrum:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;spectrum&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/center&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  There is no &#34;more&#34; or &#34;less&#34;; no &#34;high&#34; or &#34;low&#34;. There is only &#34;different&#34;.&#xA;  And yet people often still feel they&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it&#34;&gt;know it when they see it&lt;/a&gt;; that people with autism&#xA;  either act like Rain Man or don&#39;t, and that those&#xA;  are the two (if even that many) types of autism.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a&#xA;  glance?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;canary1&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;The Canary Symptom&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same&#xA;  hand. Of the many, the DSM-5 calls out a few examples:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote cite=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&#xA;    Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships,&#xA;    ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various&#xA;    social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making&#xA;    friends; to absence of interest in peers.&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html&#34;&gt;DSM-5&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Pay special attention to that first example, which I&#39;ll paraphrase as&#xA;  &#34;inability to change behavior based on social feedback&#34;. We&#39;ll come back to&#xA;  that later.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;example&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;A Personal Example&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As&#xA;  cool as it sounds, this is no superpower. My body&#39;s defense systems will&#xA;  sometimes malfunction and miscalibrate incoming volume.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Imagine you&#39;re in a coffee shop reading a book when someone walks up to you,&#xA;  takes out an air horn, points it in your ear and briefly squeezes the trigger.&#xA;  What would your brain and body do instinctively? Would it startle, flinch,&#xA;  recoil? What if the person didn&#39;t go away, and kept squeezing the trigger&#xA;  randomly every few seconds? What if you looked around and slowly realized in&#xA;  horror that everyone else had their own air horn and they have all started&#xA;  doing the same?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Your instinctive responses escalate to stress, panic, confusion. You keep&#xA;  trying to read your book but the air horns keep sounding and your body keeps&#xA;  flinching. You can&#39;t concentrate; your eyes are moving over the words in your&#xA;  book but you&#39;re not understanding them. You start getting annoyed at all the&#xA;  people wielding air horns&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;could they just not?! I&#39;m trying to read!&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is a hearing hypersensitivity. At random times, my brain will think every&#xA;  little sound is as loud as an air horn and it will execute all these&#xA;  physiological responses involuntarily. Even when I know it&#39;s a&#xA;  malfunction&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;which took me 30 years to learn&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it&#39;s still just as&#xA;  hard as ever to get through a paragraph in that book, to not flinch, to not&#xA;  become stressed, to not panic. Even when I can rationally tell myself in the&#xA;  moment &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s all in your head&lt;/i&gt;, it doesn&#39;t stop the involuntary response.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  You may understand then why I and many other people with autism would, as&#xA;  children, collapse to the floor in public, cover their ears, and scream.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;canary2&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Killing the Canary&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  In many ways, I&#39;m one of the lucky ones. I didn&#39;t get dealt that &#34;inability to&#xA;  change behavior based on social feedback&#34; symptom, above. So when as a child I&#xA;  collapsed to the floor and screamed, and other people looked at me like I was&#xA;  losing it (reminder: I was) I can log that detail away, and work a little more&#xA;  towards avoiding it next time. I&#39;ve iterated on this quite a bit over 30&#xA;  years:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;On the floor screaming&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Ears covered, eyes shut, silent&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;On the floor cross-legged, teeth gritted, trying to dissociate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Fingers-in-ears, screaming interally&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Inventing excuses to stay home&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Going home&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same.&#xA;  During a hearing hypersensitivity, inside I&#39;m still that kid rolling on the&#xA;  floor screaming. The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;canary3&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;When the Canary Lives&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  People dealt the &#34;inability to change behavior based on social feedback&#34; card&#xA;  get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what&#xA;  the world thinks autism &#34;looks like&#34;; the canary symptom that reveals the&#xA;  rest.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  The people with this symptom, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking&#xA;  it, often need more support because our world is not built to accomodate them&#xA;  or understand them well. But they are not any more &#34;low-functioning&#34; than I am&#xA;  &#34;high-functioning&#34;. Those words are descriptions of how &lt;em&gt;observers&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;  experience autism, not how autism-havers do. That&#39;s why those terms have&#xA;  fallen out of use since the DSM-5.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;masking&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;Masking&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This ability to fake not having autism is called &lt;b&gt;masking&lt;/b&gt;. Those of us&#xA;  who can mask&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;those without the canary symptom&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;mask in virtually&#xA;  every social situation.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is not a temporary &#34;get to know me and I&#39;ll stop masking&#34; deal; I mask in&#xA;  front of my mom, and Summer, and even my psychologist. It&#39;s like an emulation layer that&#xA;  sits on top of my brain so I can run programs that let me communicate with&#xA;  others, programs like &#34;talking&#34; and &#34;facial expressions&#34; and &#34;not losing it&#34;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It&#39;s not that I feel forced to do these things. I am a human&#xA;  being, so I crave social interaction. I love my friends and family and I enjoy&#xA;  interacting with them, and this is how I have to do it. I just wish we ran the&#xA;  same architecture, because masking is&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;exhausting&lt;/em&gt; [2]. My brain overclocks itself just running this&#xA;  emulation layer. It reallocates important resources from other programs like&#xA;  reason and problem-solving. I literally become dumber when I am with others.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every&#xA;  day is &#34;unmasking&#34;, which I&#39;d equate to the feeling of getting home from a&#xA;  long trip and flopping down on your own bed. Masking is a great tool and being&#xA;  able to use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory&#34;&gt;extra toll&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;radar&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Flying Under the Radar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  One risk of masking is going your whole life undiagnosed. You don&#39;t have to&#xA;  know you&#39;re masking to mask. Historically most autism diagnoses are in&#xA;  children, which is no coincidence&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;if you happen to slip past childhood&#xA;  without a diagnosis, chances are good that you&#39;re old enough to have learned&#xA;  masking, which can hide your autism forever. I narrowly avoided this fate. I&#xA;  missed diagnosis during my childhood window and it was 30 years until my&#xA;  eventual adult diagnosis, which happened more by chance than anything.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It sounds silly in retrospect to spend so much effort masking and dealing with&#xA;  other issues without realizing that other people don&#39;t, but it&#39;s difficult to&#xA;  identify atypicality when you&#39;ve only ever piloted one brain.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;selfcheck&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;The Rough Self-Check&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Medical help is the best way to find answers. But in the real world not&#xA;  everybody has access to it due to things like family, income, benefits, or&#xA;  location. It&#39;s therefore common to find people in the autism community who&#xA;  identify as self-diagnosed; they are pretty sure they have some form of autism&#xA;  based on how well others&#39; stories resonate with them, but they&#39;re either&#xA;  unwilling or unable to confirm that with a medical professional.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Even for those who are willing and able, going from ignorance to &#34;Oh! That&#xA;  happens to me too!&#34; is often the kick-start needed to seek professional&#xA;  attention. Therefore I present for your benefit a small list of&#xA;  non-professional, non-medical autism indicators that may warrant, at minimum,&#xA;  further investigation:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&#xA;    Occasional or constant annoyance at typically unannoying things like touch,&#xA;    light, or sound (sensory hypersensitivies)&#xA;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&#xA;    More than your peers, a need to dig into what people say by asking&#xA;    clarifying questions (difficulty dealing with ambiguity)&#xA;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Eliminating all facial expression when exiting a room (masking)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;More confusion about social conventions than your peers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  If these resonate with you, consider it a starting point to slingshot yourself&#xA;  into more research and, if available to you, seek a professional.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a name=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;More People than You Think&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Two percent of people have autism. There is no &#34;high-functioning&#34; or&#xA;  &#34;low-functioning&#34; autism, because autism is a deck of cards full of symptoms,&#xA;  and each hand is different. One possible symptom is a canary that reveals the&#xA;  others, but not everybody has this symptom. For those who don&#39;t, there is a&#xA;  different set of challenges, often had in private and unfortunately, often&#xA;  taken to the grave.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Be open about your own brain: what does it do well? What does it do poorly?&#xA;  Like sharing salary information, we can&#39;t know what our situation is until we&#xA;  normalize talking about it.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Because really, truly, the best part of my autism journey was just finding&#xA;  out.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;picture&gt;&#xA;    &lt;source srcset=&#34;img/autism-diagnosis-dark.png&#34; media=&#34;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&#34;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;img/autism-diagnosis-light.png&#34; style=&#34;width: 50em; max-width: 100%&#34;/&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/picture&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  [1]:&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html&#34;&gt;cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  [2]:&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking#effects&#34;&gt;healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking#effects&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;i&gt;&#xA;    Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jm.dev&#34;&gt;Jordan McQueen&lt;/a&gt; for early feedback on&#xA;    drafts of this.&#xA;  &lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

<p>
  I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical.
  I have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and
  fighting climate change. I don't need support from others on a daily basis.

<p>
  And yet my psychologist, with 30 years of experience and a Ph.D. in clinical
  psychology, wrote it right there on my medical chart:

  whose day is ruined if teeth-brushing and showering happen out of order, and
  who spends ~an hour a day performing internal conversation planning and
  retrospectives. It's the me who was mute for nine years.
</p>

<p>
  It's also the me who was taught that all these qualities are just character
  flaws that can be willed away.
</p>
<p>
  You'd never notice that me, because I hide him well. Of the folks with autism,
  I'm not an outlier in doing that. In fact, 2% of all human beings have autism
  [1]. Statistically, you've certainly met several of them without realizing it.
  Why is that, and what is it like to live that life?

  <h2>The Infamous Spectrum</h2>
</a>
<p>
  We've all heard "autism is a spectrum". But that word, "spectrum", in that
  context, has had its meaning lost to time. Often people think of folks with
  autism as "high functioning" or "low functioning", as if these are positions
  on the spectrum. But a spectrum is not a scale. This is how to actually think
  about the autism spectrum:
</p>
<p>
  </p><center>
    <div class="spectrum"> </div>
  </center>
<p></p>
<p>
  There is no "more" or "less"; no "high" or "low". There is only "different".
  And yet people often still feel they
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">know it when they see it</a>; that people with autism
  either act like Rain Man or don't, and that those
  are the two (if even that many) types of autism.
</p>
<p>
  What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a
  glance?

  Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same
  hand. Of the many, the DSM-5 calls out a few examples:
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">
  <p>
    Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships,
    ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various
    social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making
    friends; to absence of interest in peers.
  </p>
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">DSM-5</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Pay special attention to that first example, which I'll paraphrase as
  "inability to change behavior based on social feedback". We'll come back to
  that later.
</p>
<a name="example">
  <h3>A Personal Example</h3>
</a>
<p>
  One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As
  cool as it sounds, this is no superpower. My body's defense systems will
  sometimes malfunction and miscalibrate incoming volume.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you're in a coffee shop reading a book when someone walks up to you,
  takes out an air horn, points it in your ear and briefly squeezes the trigger.
  What would your brain and body do instinctively? Would it startle, flinch,
  recoil? What if the person didn't go away, and kept squeezing the trigger
  randomly every few seconds? What if you looked around and slowly realized in
  horror that everyone else had their own air horn and they have all started
  doing the same?
</p>
<p>
  Your instinctive responses escalate to stress, panic, confusion. You keep
  trying to read your book but the air horns keep sounding and your body keeps
  flinching. You can't concentrate; your eyes are moving over the words in your
  book but you're not understanding them. You start getting annoyed at all the
  people wielding air horns<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span><i>could they just not?! I'm trying to read!</i>
</p>
<p>
  This is a hearing hypersensitivity. At random times, my brain will think every
  little sound is as loud as an air horn and it will execute all these
  physiological responses involuntarily. Even when I know it's a
  malfunction<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>which took me 30 years to learn<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it's still just as
  hard as ever to get through a paragraph in that book, to not flinch, to not
  become stressed, to not panic. Even when I can rationally tell myself in the
  moment <i>It's all in your head</i>, it doesn't stop the involuntary response.
</p>
<p>
  You may understand then why I and many other people with autism would, as
  children, collapse to the floor in public, cover their ears, and scream.
</p>
<a name="canary2">
  <h3>Killing the Canary</h3>
</a>
<p>
  In many ways, I'm one of the lucky ones. I didn't get dealt that "inability to
  change behavior based on social feedback" symptom, above. So when as a child I
  collapsed to the floor and screamed, and other people looked at me like I was
  losing it (reminder: I was) I can log that detail away, and work a little more
  towards avoiding it next time. I've iterated on this quite a bit over 30
  years:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the floor screaming</li>
  <li>Ears covered, eyes shut, silent</li>
  <li>On the floor cross-legged, teeth gritted, trying to dissociate</li>
  <li>Fingers-in-ears, screaming interally</li>
  <li>Inventing excuses to stay home</li>
  <li>Going home</li>
</ol>
<p>
  My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same.
  During a hearing hypersensitivity, inside I'm still that kid rolling on the
  floor screaming. The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.
</p>
<a name="canary3">
  <h3>When the Canary Lives</h3>
</a>
<p>
  People dealt the "inability to change behavior based on social feedback" card
  get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what
  the world thinks autism "looks like"; the canary symptom that reveals the
  rest.
</p>
<p>
  The people with this symptom, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking
  it, often need more support because our world is not built to accomodate them
  or understand them well. But they are not any more "low-functioning" than I am
  "high-functioning". Those words are descriptions of how <em>observers</em>
  experience autism, not how autism-havers do. That's why those terms have
  fallen out of use since the DSM-5.
</p><a name="masking">
  <h2>Masking</h2>
</a>
<p>
  This ability to fake not having autism is called <b>masking</b>. Those of us
  who can mask<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>those without the canary symptom<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>mask in virtually
  every social situation.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a temporary "get to know me and I'll stop masking" deal; I mask in
  front of my mom, and Summer, and even my psychologist. It's like an emulation layer that
  sits on top of my brain so I can run programs that let me communicate with
  others, programs like "talking" and "facial expressions" and "not losing it".
</p>
<p>
  It's not that I feel forced to do these things. I am a human
  being, so I crave social interaction. I love my friends and family and I enjoy
  interacting with them, and this is how I have to do it. I just wish we ran the
  same architecture, because masking is
  <em>exhausting</em> [2]. My brain overclocks itself just running this
  emulation layer. It reallocates important resources from other programs like
  reason and problem-solving. I literally become dumber when I am with others.
</p>
<p>
  For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every
  day is "unmasking", which I'd equate to the feeling of getting home from a
  long trip and flopping down on your own bed. Masking is a great tool and being
  able to use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">extra toll</a>.
</p>
<a name="radar">
  <h3>Flying Under the Radar</h3>
</a>
<p>
  One risk of masking is going your whole life undiagnosed. You don't have to
  know you're masking to mask. Historically most autism diagnoses are in
  children, which is no coincidence<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>if you happen to slip past childhood
  without a diagnosis, chances are good that you're old enough to have learned
  masking, which can hide your autism forever. I narrowly avoided this fate. I
  missed diagnosis during my childhood window and it was 30 years until my
  eventual adult diagnosis, which happened more by chance than anything.
</p>
<p>
  It sounds silly in retrospect to spend so much effort masking and dealing with
  other issues without realizing that other people don't, but it's difficult to
  identify atypicality when you've only ever piloted one brain.
</p>
<a name="selfcheck">
  <h3>The Rough Self-Check</h3>
</a>
<p>
  Medical help is the best way to find answers. But in the real world not
  everybody has access to it due to things like family, income, benefits, or
  location. It's therefore common to find people in the autism community who
  identify as self-diagnosed; they are pretty sure they have some form of autism
  based on how well others' stories resonate with them, but they're either
  unwilling or unable to confirm that with a medical professional.
</p>
<p>
  Even for those who are willing and able, going from ignorance to "Oh! That
  happens to me too!" is often the kick-start needed to seek professional
  attention. Therefore I present for your benefit a small list of
  non-professional, non-medical autism indicators that may warrant, at minimum,
  further investigation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Occasional or constant annoyance at typically unannoying things like touch,
    light, or sound (sensory hypersensitivies)
  </li>
  <li>
    More than your peers, a need to dig into what people say by asking
    clarifying questions (difficulty dealing with ambiguity)
  </li>
  <li>Eliminating all facial expression when exiting a room (masking)</li>
  <li>More confusion about social conventions than your peers</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If these resonate with you, consider it a starting point to slingshot yourself
  into more research and, if available to you, seek a professional.
</p>
<a name="conclusion">
  <h2>More People than You Think</h2>
</a>
<p>
  Two percent of people have autism. There is no "high-functioning" or
  "low-functioning" autism, because autism is a deck of cards full of symptoms,
  and each hand is different. One possible symptom is a canary that reveals the
  others, but not everybody has this symptom. For those who don't, there is a
  different set of challenges, often had in private and unfortunately, often
  taken to the grave.
</p>
<p>
  Be open about your own brain: what does it do well? What does it do poorly?
  Like sharing salary information, we can't know what our situation is until we
  normalize talking about it.
</p>
<p>
  Because really, truly, the best part of my autism journey was just finding
  out.

In an open&#xA;  floorplan you can instead swivel your chair or walk to their desk.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  The pop-in is valuable because it&#39;s as informal as email, but as&#xA;  high-bandwidth and low-latency as meetings. It&#39;s interruptive to be popped in&#xA;  on, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of physically&#xA;  going somewhere is high, and the tools available to the target like doors,&#xA;  signs, and social cues are numerous and don&#39;t require much thought to&#xA;  implement.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Slack DMs come close to replacing the pop-in, but they reduce the effort too&#xA;  much. This leads to more interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot&#xA;  higher in number) and even to the replacement of trackers, emails, and wikis&#xA;  with DMs.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  There&#39;s a lot wrong with the pop-in, but like any tool it has its uses. Many&#xA;  great products&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;companies, even&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;have been built on the shoulders of&#xA;  the pop-in.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Remote Pop-In&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  There&#39;s really no remote equivalent to the pop-in.

Rather&#xA;  than build another tool, we experimented with Discord. I&#39;m happy to say we&#xA;  found something that works, and even solves the worst problem of the&#xA;  open-office pop-in: the inability to shut your damned door.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Setup&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;{{ img&#xA;  &#34;The company Discord server on a workday.&#34;&#xA;  &#34;0&#34;&#xA;  &#34;A screenshot of a Discord server with several voice channels, some empty, some having one person in them&#34;&#xA;}}&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  In our company Discord server, we give everyone one voice channel of their&#xA;  own. This is your &#34;office&#34;. When you are online and able to be disturbed, you&#xA;  join your office, alone.

But you can only hear conversations for the room you&#39;re in, and you can&#xA;  only be in one room at a time. Joining a room plays an obvious audio chime and&#xA;  is not something you can do sneakily.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  When someone wants to pop in, they join your voice channel. The chime plays,&#xA;  they say hello, you unmute and turn on video if you like, and have your&#xA;  pop-in. And that&#39;s really it.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  If you&#39;re going to the restroom and will be AFK, you can join the restroom&#xA;  channel. You&#39;re in, but away.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>The Remote Pop-In</h1>

<p>
  This page describes a method of dealing with one of the missing features of
  fully remote teams: the pop-in.

  <!-- TODO: make another about social time re: hallway conversations -->
</p>

<h2>The Pop-In</h2>
<p>
  The pop-in, back before open floorplans, is when you physically walk into
  someone's office to ask them a question or spitball an idea. In an open
  floorplan you can instead swivel your chair or walk to their desk.
</p>
<p>
  The pop-in is valuable because it's as informal as email, but as
  high-bandwidth and low-latency as meetings. It's interruptive to be popped in
  on, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of physically
  going somewhere is high, and the tools available to the target like doors,
  signs, and social cues are numerous and don't require much thought to
  implement.
</p>
<p>
  Slack DMs come close to replacing the pop-in, but they reduce the effort too
  much. This leads to more interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot
  higher in number) and even to the replacement of trackers, emails, and wikis
  with DMs.
</p>
<p>
  There's a lot wrong with the pop-in, but like any tool it has its uses. Many
  great products<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>companies, even<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>have been built on the shoulders of
  the pop-in.
</p>
<h2>The Remote Pop-In</h2>
<p>
  There's really no remote equivalent to the pop-in. There are products that
  help you "hang out" like Facebook Portal, but nothing that implements the
  pop-in.
</p>
<p>
  At <a href="https://yourbase.io">YourBase</a> we decided we needed one. Rather
  than build another tool, we experimented with Discord. I'm happy to say we
  found something that works, and even solves the worst problem of the
  open-office pop-in: the inability to shut your damned door.
</p>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
{{ img
  "The company Discord server on a workday."
  "0"
  "A screenshot of a Discord server with several voice channels, some empty, some having one person in them"
}}
<p>
  In our company Discord server, we give everyone one voice channel of their
  own. This is your "office". When you are online and able to be disturbed, you
  join your office, alone. You stay in there as long as you are "in".
</p>
<p>
  Because of how Discord works, everyone can see who is in what office at all
  times. But you can only hear conversations for the room you're in, and you can
  only be in one room at a time. Joining a room plays an obvious audio chime and
  is not something you can do sneakily.
</p>
<p>
  When someone wants to pop in, they join your voice channel. The chime plays,
  they say hello, you unmute and turn on video if you like, and have your
  pop-in. And that's really it.
</p>
<p>
  If you're going to the restroom and will be AFK, you can join the restroom
  channel. You're in, but away. No one is actually wearing a headset on the
  toilet, it's just a fun way to feel like a real office.
</p>
<p>We've even fallen into some typical office behaviors:</p>

  <li>
    We've started having meetings in people's offices, just because it's easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a "cafeteria" room where you can eat your lunch if you've got
    nothing going on in real life. We also hold lunch-and-learns here.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a "rooftop" and other common spaces where some people chill, which
    signals that they're open for a chat.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The oddest one is that when it's slow around the office, you can tell. You can
  almost hear how quiet it is when you're the first one in or the last one out.
</p>
<p>
  The pop-in is valuable because it's informal, high bandwidth, and low latency.
  Enabling it using Discord has worked very well for us over the last six
  months, and we didn't even have to build anything.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> for making such a
  flexible platform. Thanks to <a href="https://yourbase.io">YourBase</a> for
  being so open to crazy ideas. (Check us out if your CI is slow.)

It builds&#xA;  confidence in decisions. But it&#39;s often taken too far, beyond the point where&#xA;  diminishing returns have burned the marginal value away.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to share an argument for pulling back the reins a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Data optimizes funnels.

  Data optimizes funnels. But funnels are influenced by far more than most data

</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<h2>A Case Study</h2>

  Pro tip: If anyone suggests a design change you don't like, just say "Do you
  have any data to back that up?" Nobody knows how to answer this question.

<p>
  Data-driven decisions are based entirely on proxies, so it can be hard to
  grasp exactly how much influences them behind the scenes. Let's walk through
  an example: <i>Assassin's Creed</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The first <i>Assassin's Creed</i> was a risky move for a game developer: a new
  team building the entire game on new technology in a new genre. It was not
  perfect, but the risk paid off.

<p>
  The <i>Assassin's Creed II</i> trilogy resolved some shortcomings and took
  some more risks. That's what sequels to risky games are meant to do; see
  also <i>Portal 2</i>.
</p>
<p>
  But by <i>Assassin's Creed III</i>, it was clear Ubisoft had taken a different
  stance toward the series<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>the one that milks them dry. They had invented the
  perfect cow, and now they could sell milk.
</p>
<p>
  The games started looking like yearly sports games. Ubisoft announced proudly
  that it had spun up a second <i>Assassin's Creed</i> team so they could trade
  off releases every year. Wow! What a great idea.

</p>
<p>
  This is pure opinion, but starting then, every other <i>Assassin's Creed</i>
  game was a dud, and the series as a whole was on a downward slope. They were
  meticulously crafted time sinks, just barely fun enough to keep playing.
</p>
<p>
  This is the fast food industry of gaming. Cold, calculating,
  efficient<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>and effective! Assassin's Creed games are wildly successful
  because of this strategy. But it overlooks one thing.
</p>
<h2>Loyalty</h2>
<p>
  People catch on. They realize they're being sated, but not satisfied. It might
  take one game, or two, or ten, but eventually people silently stop bothering
  to keep buying the games.
</p>
<p>
  The opposite of this strategy is Nintendo. Nintendo doesn't give a shit. They
  love making amazing games, data be damned.
</p>
<p>
  They take risks, they do weird stuff, and it sometimes flops. But they never

  Wii was a flop. But they weren't mistakes. Each of them was a step towards the

</p>

<p>
  For every mistake, Nintendo gets something right. The control stick. The 3D
  platformer. The twin-stick first-person shooter. The
  <i>home video game system</i>. The handheld console. The open-world adventure
  game. The metroidvania. Where would the video game industry be if Nintendo
  milked their cows?
</p>
<p>
  Ubisoft and Nintendo are both successful companies by many measures, so it's
  hard to point at them and say "I like this one better, so the other one must
  be flawed". Any company as successful as Ubisoft must have done many things
  right, and far be it from me to tell them their philosophy is wrong.
</p>
<p>
  But as someone with a couple of successful products, it's important for me to
  make sure my philosophy is in tune with my ideals.
</p>
<p>
  I want to be like Nintendo. And I don't know for sure to what extent they use
  data, but anyone who's interacted with their software a lot knows it's at
  least an order of magnitude less than a traditional tech company.
</p>
<h3>A Personal Aside</h3>
<p>
  I chose Nintendo as an example here because I like them. I line up about 18
  hours before any home Nintendo console launches. It's chill, with people
  passing cocoa, playing guitar, and being thankful Nintendo console launches
  don't yield near-death experiences and eBay scalpers like other console launches.
</p>

  <a href="http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/12437/los-angeles-wii-launch-report" class="text-muted">Nintendo
    World Report</a>)
</p>
<p>
  It was this chillfolk vibe for the Gamecube, the Nintendo DS, and the Wii. But
  for the Wii U, something was different. No one else showed up. I sat alone in
  the dark all night. An unseen concerned citizen, presumably an employee not knowing
  why I was there, called the cops on me. By the time the doors opened, only nine people
  had lined up, all after sunrise.
</p>
<p>At those wee hours into the night, staving off sleep with excitement and hot cocoa, I remember
  thinking <i>Where is everybody? Did
    I get the date right?</i>.</p>
<p>
  I did. There was no one there because the Wii U was horribly marketed ("So it's an
  add-on for Wii?") and had no launch
  games worth buying one for.
  Nintendo failed me. I'd done what superfans do: I gave my heart, my time, and
  my money, and it was all a big let-down.
</p>
<p>I don't care. Look at this:</p>
<center><code> ----------------------------------- </code></center>
<p>
  That's my loyalty bar towards Nintendo before the Wii U. Now look at this:
</p>
<center><code> ----------------------------- </code></center>
<p>
  That's my loyalty bar towards Nintendo after the Wii U. Only a handful of
  brands in my life can take a hit like that. <i>Assassin's Creed</i> certainly
  isn't one of them.
</p>
<h4>Nintendo and Risks</h4>
<p>
  Nintendo takes crazy risks based on what sometimes feel like acid trip ideas.
  Think about the premise of Animal Crossing for a second.
</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->

</p>
<p>
  You can't make this up by looking at data, but it worked, and it filled
  loyalty bars. These bars aren't exposed in data, at least not until a lifetime
  of it passes you by. But everyone has one.
</p>
<p>
  Bad decisions can reflect well on the data while still being bad decisions. If
  you make it impossible for users to cancel their subscriptions, will fewer
  users cancel their subscriptions? Probably! Does that mean you should do it?
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Being data-driven is hard. Adding instrumentation and A/B tests, along with
  extra specs, coordination, and maintenance takes a lot of time that could be
  spent building.
</p>
<p>
  Try making the 80/20 trade-off. Put an analytics snippet in your footer or
  whatever the trend is nowadays. But ditch the experiments framework, scaffolding, headache,
  and personpower in exchange for a 10x velocity on gut-driven features.
</p>
<p>
  Hard-to-measure things like loyalty bars defy the charts, but are at least as
  important as them. If you one day discovered users just wanted to be charmed
  and feel butterflies, wouldn't you charm them and build butterflies?

      <title>Let me start off with an introduction...</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/netneutrality.html.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post from 2013 was migrated from my old blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Let me start off with an introduction...&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(that makes sense, doesn&#39;t it?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been wanting to maintain (&lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;) a blog for a long time.&#xA;I&#39;ve had many before, but none ever had more than a few posts, mostly&#xA;meaningless, on them before I called it quits. Over and over again, I&#39;ve set new&#xA;ones up, dedicating myself to keeping them active, but the result always turns&#xA;out the same.

<h1>Let me start off with an introduction...</h1>

<p>(that makes sense, doesn't it?)</p>

<p>I've been wanting to maintain (<em>maintain</em>, not <em>have</em>) a blog for a long time.
I've had many before, but none ever had more than a few posts, mostly
meaningless, on them before I called it quits. Over and over again, I've set new
ones up, dedicating myself to keeping them active, but the result always turns
out the same. My (once more) renewed motivation to set up and continually
maintain a blog has been fueled by the dream of having a voice on the internet,
whether it has little or great influence. This blog is my solution to that
desire.</p>

<p>So, now that that's over with...</p>

<p>There's this little thing I've been reading about called <strong>network neutrality</strong>.
Apparently, internet service providers (ISPs) such as
<a href="http://comcast.net/">Comcast</a>, <a href="http://verizon.com/">Verizon</a> and
<a href="http://att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> are purposefully slowing or blocking access to certain
websites and internet-dependable programs to lower these programs' creators'
reputations. For instance, AT&amp;T may slow their customers' connections with
<a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> to imply that Google is a slow search engine, which
causes said customers to use other search engines, such as the one belonging to
the ISP (<a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> in this case) or other companies who are
paying AT&amp;T to go through this process.</p>

<p>This little thing I mentioned earlier called <strong>net neutrality</strong> is the idea that
users should be able to connect to any server they wish without ISP-caused
connection slows or blocks. Internet users are banding together to ensure a
neutrality among the internet. Head over to
<a href="http://savetheinternet.com/">SaveTheInternet.com</a> to find out what you can do
to help, including <a href="http://action.freepress.net/campaign/savethenet">signing the
petition</a>. Each signature
counts and is automatically sent to your Members of Congress.</p>

<h1>World of Warcraft</h1>

<p>Yeah, you knew it was coming. If you despise <em>World of Warcraft</em> (or MMORPG’s in
general), maybe you should stop reading here if you don’t want to throw up.</p>

<p>I started playing in September 2005, right when I started my job (where both my
coblogger and I still work) because about half of the employees there played
religiously, so I figured, <em>why the hell not</em>.</p>

<p>At that time I had been exploring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">multi-user
dungeons</a>, which are basically text-based
MMORPG’s, but I guess <em>WoW</em> sounded more appealing when everyone got into
talking about it. It was a nice sort of ice-breaker, too <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I’m not a big
initiator of smalltalk, so actually having something real (if you can call it
that ) to talk about was a good way to pass the time.</p>

<p>You could probably view my track record with WoW as a tipsy relationship. You
could say we went out for about six months, but then we got bored of each other
and separated. You could then say we got back together a few months later with
more passion than ever <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I was always bad at sticking to one character, but
during this passion period, I played only my mage for about three or four weeks,
getting him from the mid-30’s to 54 <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> which was the largest spike in our
relationship.</p>

<p>You could also say that once the effects of the spike dwindled away, our
relationship again grew repetitive and boring, so we took another break <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> one
that lasted about two months.</p>

<p>And now, after the serious lows and the serious highs, it’s almost like we’ve
landed right in the middle <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> right at the sweet spot. I like to play it enough
to maintain my characters, but not enough to cut myself off from all the other
good games out there <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it’s an open relationship.</p>

<p>I’ve given up on getting better gear for my 70 (the mage I leveled in such a
hurry for <em>Burning Crusade</em>) because of the upcoming release of <em>Wrath of the
Lich King</em>. Instead I’m just leveling a handful of alts, trying not to rush
through them.</p>

<p>These include an 11 priest, a 32 druid, a 40 warlock (free mounts ftw) all on
the same server.</p>

<p>I would review the game itself instead of my history with it, but reviewing
MMORPG’s is a touchy subject <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> my opinions would probably be way more biased
than usual, and (not even as an affect of that) people would probably exaggerate
the review depending on their attitude towards MMO’s.</p>

<p>And apparently because it’s Christmas, my family and I are going to do family
things like make waffles and play Monopoly. So I should wrap this up.</p>

<p>Blegh.</p>

<p>(not at the waffles <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> waffles are the pwnzage)</p>

<h1>Mad at emotion</h1>

<p>Pretty much anyone who has watched any family sitcom or movie knows that a lot
of the comedy that comes out of things like that is through certain main
characters getting frustrated, angry or fed-up with someone or something.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s a little vague. Let me give an example.</p>

<p>Right now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_We_There_Yet%3F"><em>Are We There
Yet?</em></a> is on TV, and I’ve been
passively watching it. One of the scenes involves the two kids Nick (the main
character, played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube">Ice Cube</a>) is
taking care of pretty much stealing his car. They trick him into getting out of
the car, then they lock the doors and speed around the parking lot.</p>

<p>Ha-ha, comedic scene. That’s what I want to talk about.</p>

<p>As a side-note, I have nothing against this movie; it just happens to be the
most handy example.</p>

<p>I can only assume, and I guess I can understand, that most people find those
kinds of things funny. But for some reason, I just don’t. Instead of laughing or
just saying “Those silly kids”, I kinda hate them at the moment. As much as if
they were doing that kind of stuff to me.</p>

<p>I don’t know why; I just hate them. It’s like I get too attached to the
characters or something. I understand their feelings too much.</p>

<p>And I’ve got to say, it really bugs me. I can no longer watch <em>Everybody Loves
Raymond</em> comfortably <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I admit, it was getting old anyway, but it’s just so
annoying now. Every time Marie makes a passing insult at Debra, or every time
Debra does something crazy to Ray <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> like throw a spoonful of brownie mix in his
face for making a stupid remark <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I just get so angry.</p>

<p>It’s like <em>I’m</em> the victim, like <em>I</em> just got a spoonful of liquid chocolate in
my face just for saying something stupid by accident. I mean, imagine if that
was you. Imagine if you accidentally said something stupid or insulting (we all
have) to a spouse (or friend), and they just gave you this death stare and threw
a spoonful of chocolate in your face.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’d be hella pissed. I mean, that would be totally
unnecessary. I’d get so mad, I don’t even know what I’d do to cool off.</p>

<p><em>So why is this funny on TV?</em> I can understand that things on TV can be funnier
than similar things in real life (believe me; I’m a hardcore <em>Seinfeld</em> fan),
but I don’t know about this whole anger thing. As far as I know I haven’t met
anyone else who has this problem (not that I ask upon meeting someone or

<p>It’s a real burden on a person, relating to a fictional character’s emotions. I

opposite: I’ve often been accused of looking depressed or angry when I’m just in
deep thought.</p>

<p>And I like being in deep thought. Because all the emotions in deep thought are
my own.</p>

<p>That, and Deep Thought calculated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything">The

<h1>Thinking about thinking</h1>

<p>You ever have those periods of time during your day, when you don’t have quite
enough time to start doing something (like playing a game) but you have too much
time to just wait out?</p>

<p>I’m totally having one of those periods of time right now.</p>

<p>So I can finally follow the trend and say I have dug one up from the archives.
This one balances itself out <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it’s a little deep (psychologically), but short:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The human mind always thinks ahead.</p>

<p>It’s why excitement is a greater emotion than happiness; why fear is a greater
emotion than disappointment. It’s why we love Fridays but hate Sundays.</p>

<p>If our minds never thought ahead, we’d never do anything that would benefit us
in the future.</p>

<p>In example, we would never make shelter unless it rained. We fear it will
rain, so we make shelter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In retrospect, it seems like one of those “uh, duh!” things, but maybe it’s just
one of those things you <em>know</em> but never really <em>realize</em>. Maybe read over the
second sentence more carefully if you’re not sure what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>I’ve still been meaning to write some more Game Loads posts, but having lots of
games to play makes it easy to skip out on writing about having lots of games to
play.</p>

<p>Meh, I’ll get around to it.</p>

<p>PRE-PUBLISH EDIT: Apparently, the first (or maybe dominant) tag called “fear”
ever used on WordPress was actually “F.E.A.R” (the game), so when I try to tag
this post with the emotion, it kindly tags it with the game instead.</p>

<p>Um, thanks WordPress?</p>

<h1>Shouldering time</h1>

<p>This couldn’t have been more horribly timed.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, I’m in the middle of a slew of awesome games right now.
There are just too many I need to play <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it’s like when two of your favorite
shows are on at the same time. And, uh, you are twenty years in the past. Where,
y’know, you can’t download/stream/browse on demand for/digitally record them.</p>

<p>But watch your back <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> the gaming gods get mad at you when you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">play with
fire</a> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I’m proof of that.</p>

<p>Today, my DS broke. Broke is a rather vague word, so I’ll explain.</p>

<p>Only a couple days ago, I noticed my L button wasn’t functioning as smoothly as
it’s supposed to <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> one of the games I’ve been playing lately is Megaman ZX
(which I haven’t covered in my rounds yet), and one of the fastest ways to
travel is by using Model Hx (the biometal of the wind) to dash-jump, air dash,
and repeat. Both of those moves require the L button (dash), which is how I
first noticed it (of course, that constant use probably didn’t help, but hey, I
didn’t do anything wrong).</p>

<p>Instead of being able to press it from the edge, I had to hug my finger around
the top of the DS and push it down, and pretty hard.</p>

<p>Yesterday, it stopped functioning altogether. I was playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars:_Galaxies#Nintendo_DS_and_Wii_versions">Geometry
Wars</a>
and kept wondering, <em>Why are all these new levels not giving me any bombs?</em> And
of course, I still don’t know which symbol means <em>bombs</em> and which means lives.</p>

<p>So yeah, point made, my L button is broken. And I’m sad. Because there are five
DS games in queue for me right now (yup, those are all upcoming game loads), and
I have to send off my DS to get repaired.</p>

<p>At least it’s in the warranty. And Nintendo’s usually <a href="http://fiendishgleeclub.vox.com/library/post/customer-service-gone-shockingly-right.html">really
cool</a>
about this kind of stuff, so I don’t expect any problems to come up.</p>

<p>Maybe the gaming gods are looking out for me after all.</p>

You have a huge axe you can fight with too, but according to your&#xA;advisor, you’re too good for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An appealing part of the game is the number of uses for the minions, and the&#xA;awesome ways in which they’re applied. Aside from fighting (which can get pretty&#xA;awesome, what with your minions jumping onto your enemies’ backs and pretty much&#xA;riding them around), the minions can do things like move large obstacles out of&#xA;the way (which will require x minions to do depending on the size of the object;&#xA;this makes for the revelation of new areas pretty smooth as you can command more&#xA;and more minions at once), turn big wheels to open doors or drop drawbridges,&#xA;and fit through or across small areas like tunnels or coincidental bridges made&#xA;of small tree branches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your minions also pick up random stuff that can help them along their way,&#xA;ranging from makeshift weapons (like pieces of fences, if I remember correctly)&#xA;to pumpkin helms. That’s right; if you tell your minions to attack random things&#xA;(which they will sometimes do on their own if they’re in the area) &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; like&#xA;pumpkins &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; they’ll do crazy stuff like put them on their heads, even if it&#xA;doesn’t help them one bit.

<hr/>

<h1>Overlord</h1>

<p>A second game I’ve been trying to play lately is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_%282007_video_game%29">Overlord</a>, which,
despite its lack of hype (that I’ve heard of, anyway), is actually a pretty
great game (then again, it came out almost six months ago). I’ve been told by my
fellow blogger that it’s extremely similar to Pikmin, which I, of course, never
bought.In short, you play as a dark overlord (who would guess?), and you do
battle by sending in your minions, who are a little like demonic gremlins, to
fight for you. You have a huge axe you can fight with too, but according to your
advisor, you’re too good for that.</p>

<p>An appealing part of the game is the number of uses for the minions, and the
awesome ways in which they’re applied. Aside from fighting (which can get pretty
awesome, what with your minions jumping onto your enemies’ backs and pretty much
riding them around), the minions can do things like move large obstacles out of
the way (which will require x minions to do depending on the size of the object;
this makes for the revelation of new areas pretty smooth as you can command more
and more minions at once), turn big wheels to open doors or drop drawbridges,
and fit through or across small areas like tunnels or coincidental bridges made
of small tree branches.</p>

<p>Your minions also pick up random stuff that can help them along their way,
ranging from makeshift weapons (like pieces of fences, if I remember correctly)
to pumpkin helms. That’s right; if you tell your minions to attack random things
(which they will sometimes do on their own if they’re in the area) <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> like
pumpkins <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> they’ll do crazy stuff like put them on their heads, even if it
doesn’t help them one bit. That’s one of the things that really brings them to
life: they’re not just mindless creatures who obey your every word and only your
every word (although they are quite loyal) <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> they like to have some fun, too.</p>

<p>You also have a huge castle that you can customize with enough money <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> a nice
perk, but (so far for me) has served no super-meaningful purpose.</p>

<p>And the last thing I’ll mention is paths. Lots of games have been adding this
lately to dynam-ify storylines <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> you can choose your character’s personal path
through the the actions you perform. In most cases, your actions end up deciding
whether you’re good or evil in the end (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Messiah_of_Might_and_Magic">Dark
Messiah</a> is an
excellent example of this), but since <em>Overlord</em>‘s whole concept is pretty much
based around being evil, you get to choose between evil and <em>really</em> evil.</p>

<p>As you might guess, killing innocent people leans you towards the <em>really evil</em>
side. Every time you kill someone who would otherwise befriend you, you get
their life force, and 1 life force = 1 more minion you have available to summon.
You also get some decent cash from their pockets.</p>

<p>The disadvantage to doing this, as your advisor states, is that to rule an evil
empire, you actually have to have <em>people</em> to rule over <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> so killing everyone
isn’t too much of an option. I have yet to complete the game, so I’m not sure of
the gameplay differences between the two paths yet, but I’m sure there will be
some.</p>

<p>One last thing, because I know you’re waiting for it: graphics. They’re <em>very</em>
decent. If you’re talking about sole graphics, they’re up there with Half-Life
2, but that doesn’t take into account physics, the actual <em>use</em> of the graphics,
and the cooperation between the two. And some unrelated things could use some
work.</p>

<p>For instance, you can set fields of dry grass on fire once you get the
appropriate spell, and the trees in that field will switch to a dry and burnt
model when the fire spreads to them (which all is very cool to see happen), but
the trees just swap from one model to the other, and the instant change is very
noticeable. At least cross-fade between the models or something.</p>

<p>Definitely not something to cry over, though <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> from the first time you set foot
into non-evil lands, you can feel the happiness vibes emitting from everything
from the sheep to the swaying grass <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> one of which you will slaughter and the
other of which you will set fire to.</p>

<h1>Crysis</h1>

<p>I’m one of those people who pretty much just has to play any game I’m excited
for (a recent example of this is when I bought Halo 3 with no 360 to play it on
and had to get a friend to lend me his, so long as I <a href="halo3.html">give him the
game</a> afterwards). And being a pretty heavy gamer, I get excited for
quite a lot of games.</p>

<p>So often times I approach a sort of pickle in my gaming life, much like the one
I’m in right now. I’m sure many others have encountered the situation: a slew of
new games all come out within a few weeks of each other, and you simply don’t
have enough time to play them all as much as you want. It’s a weird situation,
having too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>This was originally going to be a post about all of those games, but let’s split
it up into chunks:</p>

<p>One of the games I’ve been trying to work into my schedule is, of course,
Crysis. I won’t waste keystrokes trying to explain the awesomeness of its
graphics and physics (I’m no graphics whore, but hey <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> a good thing is a good
thing), because I’m sure everyone who’s heard of Crysis has probably heard about
it in some reference to graphical detail. Rather, I’d like to explain somewhat
the opposite: the lack of possible graphics.</p>

<p><strong>Before I start trippin’ up all in your grill,</strong> I’m talking about the DirectX9
version here. And I’m in no way trying to criticize its capabilities; in fact,
I’m trying to bring them out. It’s been circulating around the ‘net that when
Crysis runs on DX9, its graphical intensity is purposefully not as high as it
can be, presumably to make people say “Oh man, DX9 sucks compared to DX10, now
I’m going to go spend some money on Vista and a new graphics card so I can
experience the awesomeness.”</p>

<p>A (somewhat) recent <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/bliss/">comparison</a> of the DX9
and DX10 versions of Crysis somewhat reveals this <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> throughout the page,
screenshots taken on DX9 Crysis are shown, and on rollover you can see the DX10
versions of the exact same screenshots. But at the bottom, <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/bliss/crysis-config-settings-tweaks.html">some
instructions</a>
are mentioned to allow DX9 to run on some high-end settings that supposedly only
DX10 can handle <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> apparently Crytek has “chosen to artificially limit some of
the game’s graphics effects to only the DX10 version in order to create a bigger
perceived difference.”</p>

<p>Not cool, man.</p>

<p>DX10 is still (I hear) much better than 9, but why would Crytek choose to
disallow DX9 to work up to its full potential? Are they trying to encourage
people to get DX10 cards to prepare for the future, or did Microsoft have some
say in this?</p>

      <title>Fun with hardware (OR: The physical world and you)</title>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post from 2007 was migrated from my old blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://ifeelasleep.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;I FEEL&#xA;ASLEEP&lt;/a&gt;, which was shared with&#xA;Neverhitboxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Fun with hardware (OR: The physical world and you)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was right. It &lt;a href=&#34;juven2.html&#34;&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had burned Ubuntu onto a DVD and was trying to read it with a CD drive. BLAHG!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I reburned it and it installed fine.

<h1>Fun with hardware (OR: The physical world and you)</h1>

<p>I was right. It <a href="juven2.html">was</a> something stupid.</p>

<p>I had burned Ubuntu onto a DVD and was trying to read it with a CD drive. BLAHG!</p>

<p>So I reburned it and it installed fine. I actually wasn’t expecting that Ubuntu
Server would be as command-line-dependent as it is (no desktop environment
whatsoever), but it makes sense. I’ve just got to look up anything I want to do
at another computer, write it down, then run upstairs and type it in, since my
own computer isn’t at this house and I have to use the family’s.</p>

<p>So far I’ve gotten it hooked up to the ‘net and running Apache, MySQL, PHP and
an FTP server, although I’ve only had the chance to test the FTP server so far.
But before I get too bogged down on getting it all ready-to-go on the software
half, I actually have to <em>get everything in that case.</em></p>

<p>What I did (or am attempting to do) with the case is kinda stupid, actually. I
just took the old case, ripped out the HDD and CDD bays with just a screwdriver
and my now-cut-in-several-places hands, repositioned the former, left out the
latter, and fastened (if you can call it that) the power supply on top of the
bay using a seriously-bent piece of metal and a screw.</p>

<p>In retrospect, all this did was make the final assembly one
power-supply-worth-of-height shorter and give me a computer that was held
together by nothing more than twisted metal and a few of the original screws.
Not to mention, now the power supply is on the <em>other side of the case</em> compared
to the graphics card and motherboard <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> so I’ll end up plugging in the power cord
into the <em>front</em> of the computer.</p>

<p>Talk about deranged.</p>

<p>Oh, and just an update on one of my <a href="realtors.html">previous posts</a>: we never
actually lost a cat like I thought; she was just hiding somewhere. I sure as
hell don’t know <em>where</em>, because I pretty much used all my wallhacks to look for
her, but whatever; she’s here and safe.</p>

<p>I’ll finish off the post with this: almost every day I have a song stuck in my
head (usually a good one). Today it’s Time Warp from the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show">The Rocky Horror
Picture Show</a> (which
was made after a musical containing the same song), and I can’t figure out where
I’ve heard the mini-chorus part of it before, but I have to say, it’s a really
good song, despite its unusual containment in this movie. I just want to get up
and do the dance. It’s kinda weird. But good, too.</p>

<p>But weird.</p>

<h1>Juven assembly</h1>

<p>I was working on <a href="juven.html">juven</a> last night, and something occured to me:</p>

<p>I have no idea what I’m doing.</p>

<p>In the abstract software world, I can navigate around as easily as a limo driver
with on-board navigation. In the physical hardware world, I am a kid on a bike
in San Fransisco.</p>

<p>My first night didn’t work out to what I had hoped for. I stripped one of my old
cases down to (and past) its base structure to attempt creation of a smaller
case, but only succeeded in forcefully ripping out both sides of the hard drive
bay and giving my finger a small (but rather deep) gash.</p>

<p>In the very least, I was happy with myself for plugging all the scattered cords
into the motherboard in the right places. I’ve built millions of gajillions of
computers in my life (by millions of gajillions I mean three), so I’m at least
somewhat familiar with this stuff, but it’s more fun when, instead of taking the
labeled cords from your brand spankin’ new case and plugging them into their
corresponding motherboard slots (i.e. power LED, hard drive LED, power switch,
reset switch), you end up salvaging those lights and switches from other
computers in their most basic forms (a cord with a light or a button on the end)
and duct taping them to the front of the case <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> if you can even call a heap of
metal like this a case anymore.</p>

<p>I decided to take a break from all this hardware stuff you guys like to call
real life and just try to get Ubuntu installed. I hooked up a loose hard drive,
plugged in a keyboard and mouse that seemed more like dust bunnies than
peripherals, and fired it up. But wait <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> what’s this? YOU’RE NOT BOOTING FROM
MAH CD?! Is the BIOS checking for it? Let’s see…yes. Is the CD drive hooked up?
…Yep, it looks like it. WHAT’S WRONG?!</p>

<p>Find out next time on this nonexistent show!</p>

<p>I’ll be trying some more stuff with it over the weekend, when I get back to my
dad’s house. I’m sure it’s something stupid.</p>

<h1>Project Juven</h1>

<p>I’ve decided to try to rebuild one of my current webservers (named palae, and
yes, I name my servers) into a smaller, quieter, and more efficient machine
without spending much money. Right now it’s got a fairly oversized case, a
<em>very</em> loud power supply when turned up to full blast (which, for some reason,
is required for the server not to overheat even when idle), and a hard drive
with too much old stuff on it (including two operating systems which enjoy
conflicting with each other).</p>

<p>So I’ve decided to try toning it down quite a few notches by stripping it of
everything and starting almost anew with more power-conservant (and less
noise-producent) parts. Which, I guess, actually works out fine, considering
that most devices which don’t require much power are simply out-of-date ones,
which I have plenty of.</p>

<p>So assuming that I actually decide to go through with this project, I’ll be
posting about my progress off and on. My tasks will include:</p>

<p>swapping out the current 500GB hard drive for one or two 8’s that I have in my
closet using a suckier graphics card that doesn’t gobble down so much power
installing Ubuntu Server Edition (with LAMP) fitting it all in a less obtrusive
case I’ve got extended hours at work this weekend because of Halloween, so I
probably won’t get to start this until Monday.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, if you haven’t guessed, this new, <em>rejuvenated</em>, server,
will be appropriately named juven.</p>

<p>EDIT: In other news, <a href="http://www.davidlouisedelman.com/">my favorite author</a> has

<h1>They're taking over my room...</h1>

<p>So the realtors have captured exactly one-half of my room. In the far end, my
Nintendo character poster, my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">ATLA</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterbation">rasterbation</a> and my bed have all
been defeated and replaced with schmancy art posters and thought-to-be-neat bed
comforters. In the near end, my desk, my Kramer poster and my electronics have
been untouched.</p>

<p>It’s a square-off.</p>

<p>A game of capture-the-point, if you will. We must reclaim the middle of my room!</p>

<p>However, the opposing force has an unfair advantage: the window. It’s open, and
come morning the sun will be a destructive force against our nocturnal nature.
Even if we manage to capture the objective tonight, by tomorrow we will be
unable to hold it. The only option is to retreat to a casing and live to fight
another day. The casing may be flimsy, and it may break easily under rain, but
this…this <em>cardboard box</em>…it is our only hope. We must accept it.</p>

<p><em>Anyways</em>, today they painted the front door, so they needed to keep it <em>wide</em>
open for a while so it could dry. Apparently they didn’t know I have three cats
that are supposed to stay indoors and one that’s supposed to stay outdoors. I’m
the only house resident around (my siblings are in college and my mom &amp; step-dad
are on vacation), so not even the realtors knew about our cat situation until I
got home from school. I managed to scrounge up two of the insider cats, and the
contractor, a family friend, knew that the outside one was only supposed to come
in to eat, so he took care of that.</p>

<p>It’s 7:00p and I am now the only one home. And I’m not sure where one of the
indoor cats is. She’s usually pretty reclusive, so I’m <em>hoping</em> she’s just
hiding somewhere, but frankly I’ve looked everywhere she could viably be and
have found no trace. She’s got a collar and everything, so if she did get out, I
think we’ll be fine so long as she comes across any decent people, but I’m still
in a nervous state until then. I emailed my mom to see if there’re any places
she hides in that I don’t know about, but I don’t think there are many places I
didn’t check.</p>

<p>It’s too late to do much about it now; it’s very dark outside and I haven’t
heard back from my mom yet, so I’ll have to wait until tomorrow in a situation
that makes waiting horrible.</p>

      <title>Haunted Phones and Shampooed Carpet</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/haunted.html.html</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post from 2007 was migrated from my old blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://ifeelasleep.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;I FEEL&#xA;ASLEEP&lt;/a&gt;, which was shared with&#xA;Neverhitboxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Haunted Phones and Shampooed Carpet&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I’m sitting here in my chair with a portable house phone by my side. Okay,&#xA;normal situation &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; but at very odd intervals, this phone is beeping several&#xA;times because it is being paged. And this is no soft sound &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; it BEEPS, and&#xA;LOUDLY. Understandably, because the page function is meant to assist location of&#xA;the phone, but still &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; this is LOUD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The even stranger part is that I’m the only person home. Nobody’s trying to&#xA;locate this phone. Now, I’ve got four cats, so I assume one of them is laying&#xA;down on, playing with, or knocking over the station, but I can’t do a thing&#xA;about it. You know why? &lt;em&gt;I have no idea where the hell it even is.&lt;/em&gt; I don’t have&#xA;a big house &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; it’s not terribly small, but I don’t live in a mansion or anything&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; but I can’t seem to locate this stupid station. Before you think I’m weird for&#xA;not knowing where my home phone’s charger is, know that it’s probably been moved&#xA;in the last week or so because of our attempts at cleaning up the house for&#xA;selling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think it’s an open house today once our realtor gets here, so she’s&#xA;going to be just showing people around while I’m sitting here trying to do&#xA;whatever.

<h1>Haunted Phones and Shampooed Carpet</h1>

<p>So I’m sitting here in my chair with a portable house phone by my side. Okay,
normal situation <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> but at very odd intervals, this phone is beeping several
times because it is being paged. And this is no soft sound <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it BEEPS, and
LOUDLY. Understandably, because the page function is meant to assist location of
the phone, but still <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> this is LOUD.</p>

<p>The even stranger part is that I’m the only person home. Nobody’s trying to
locate this phone. Now, I’ve got four cats, so I assume one of them is laying
down on, playing with, or knocking over the station, but I can’t do a thing
about it. You know why? <em>I have no idea where the hell it even is.</em> I don’t have
a big house <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it’s not terribly small, but I don’t live in a mansion or anything
<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> but I can’t seem to locate this stupid station. Before you think I’m weird for
not knowing where my home phone’s charger is, know that it’s probably been moved
in the last week or so because of our attempts at cleaning up the house for
selling.</p>

<p>In fact, I think it’s an open house today once our realtor gets here, so she’s
going to be just showing people around while I’m sitting here trying to do
whatever. People are going to be walking into my room and assessing it while I’m
just gaming or something. Weird.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the subject at hand. I’ve given up looking for this
mysteriously-located phone station, because the more I do the more my feet get
wet from our carpet, which was shampooed yesterday for the same reason mentioned
above. So I’ve confined myself to just sitting in my chair with my legs pulled
up; my own little island in the sea of wet carpet that is my house.</p>

<p>I’ll finish off this entry with a thoughtful comic I worked on for like five
minutes a number of months ago, and just today decided to finish off. I know the
trophy sucks, I know the white background looks horrible on this page, and I
know it’s not funny (it’s not supposed to be). I just needed to finish this and
get some feel of completion for myself.</p>

<li><strong>8:30p</strong> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span> Episode Two: beaten.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was pretty much my favorite day in quite a while. The following are rants
about the awesomeness about the games involved in it.</p>

<p><strong>Portal</strong> is <em>awesome</em>. Let me say that I’m not totally new to this concept <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>
I’ve very repeatedly played with similar systems in Prey (with the custom
portal-creation mod) and Narbacular Drop (the game from which <em>Portal</em> evolved,
created by a group of students from Digipen who now all happily work for Valve),
but Portal combines the slickness and meaning of the former with the
portal-focused gameplay from the latter to make an <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> I simply must repeat myself
<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> awesome game.</p>

<p>I’ve said before that I’m a huge storyline guy, and although no trailers do this
one justice, the intricacy of it is really something to take into consideration;
it’s much deeper than you’d imagine, even after playing completely through it.
At first you’re just like, “Oh, so I’m this test participant for this awesome
portal stuff, that’s cool”, but it gets so much more intricate <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> to an amount
that I actually do not know at this time, but is sure to be hinted at upon the
arrival of Episode Three (yep, you guessed it <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> <em>Portal</em> takes place in the
Half-Life universe, and this is actually apparent during play of Episode Two; a
matter which surely will be delved into further along in the episodes).</p>

<p>As for <strong>Episode Two</strong>: JEEZ VALVE, FINALLY!</p>

<p>Now that that’s out of my system, I can say that it’s actually a pretty good
game. You can really tell how much work they put into the engine <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> maybe not
through huge, blatantly noticeable things, but small things, like how when
you’re in a cave the light reflections look much, well, shinier, and how (I love
this) when you spin to face another direction really fast, your screen actually
<em>blurs</em> <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it sounds trivial, but it’s a pretty awesome thing when you notice it
for the first time (if you came into my room when I noticed it, you’d just watch
me spinning around in circles really fast for about two minutes straight).</p>

<p>There isn’t a <em>whole</em> lot of new stuff in it (a new car and a new type of mine
come to mind), but the storyline actually starts to connect more with that of
Half-Life 1 (notice I only said starts to <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> there are just a few things
mentioned about some memories from the original Half-Life that could have to do
with your future success), as well as <em>Portal</em>, as I mentioned already.</p>

<p>I hate to leave <em>Team Fortress 2</em> out of the party, but I’d already played it in
beta, so I’m not as super-excited about it right now. Make no mistake, though:
The Orange Box is a purchase <em>well</em> worth the money if you’re any sort of fan at
all of Half-Life or its relatives. Come to think of it, I think most people
would enjoy <em>Portal</em> despite their gaming background.</p>

<h1>Phantom Limbs and Hourglasses</h1>

<p>So we learned about a…disease, if you could call it that, in AP Psych today.
It’s called Phantom Limb Syndrome, and imagine this: it occurs when you have a
missing limb (which is enough for me) and you <em>have an itch on it</em>.</p>

<p>But you can’t scratch it. Because it’s not there.</p>

<p>TALK ABOUT ANNOYING!!!</p>

<p>You can also feel pain in it sometimes, usually something that feels like it’s
being held <em>in a flame</em>. Ouch. This occurs because sensation is completely
located in the brain; not the body part. So if something goes wrong in the
transfer of information in your brain (or something like that), you feel stuff
in a body part that doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>And speaking of ice cream, I’ve been playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom
Hourglass</em> for DS recently, which came out the day before yesterday. It rocks! I
never thought a game that uses virtually only the stylus could be comfortable,
but it feels pretty natural (there’s always that position you have to find where
you’re holding your DS with only your left hand and/or leaning it up against
something so you can freely use your right hand for the stylus, though). The
world and the exploration of it isn’t as needlessly huge as <em>Wind Waker</em>‘s was
(not that I’m complaining), but still makes good use of the boat you have at
your disposal (draw a route to take, let your captain/partner do the driving
(boating?) and take care of baddies and obstacles by shooting and jumping (I’m
still in a complete daze as to how boats can <em>jump</em>, but hey, if you’ve gotta
jump something, you’ve gotta jump it)).</p>

<p>I actually just finished a multiplayer session with my fellow blogger (and got
owned), which is also a lot better than I thought it’d be the first time I tried
it. There’re no tools to use from single-player; it’s actually more of a game of
cat-and-mouse. One player controls Link, and the other controls three Phantoms.
Phantoms cannot be killed, and a single blow from them will kill Link, but they
are somewhat slow and more sluggish to control <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> instead of a standard
go-to-where-the-stylus-is-pointing movement system, they rely on the player to
draw them paths on the map (which is on the lower screen for this player) to
travel along. The player of Link must carry force gems (kinda like Triforce
shards) to their designated zone to earn points. The bigger the force gem, the
more points it’s worth, but the slower you walk while carrying it. Players
switch off roles every round.</p>

<p>Anyways, it’s a pretty sweet setup, and if you’ve got a DS, you need this game <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>
Zelda fan or not (although the former would probably appreciate it more). But
beware, ornamentalists <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> this game sports the cel-shaded goodness of <em>Wind
Waker</em> (my favorite kind).</p>

<p>I should probably start collecting the condensation from my soda…it’s starting
to pool.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> Valve just triggered preloads for <em>Portal</em> and
<em>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</em>, so I’m pumped to start playing them come release.
Nothing’s better <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> and nothing’s worse <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> than being as close as possible to your
goal (having the games <em>on my computer</em>!) and not being able to reach it.</p>

<p>OMGSOEXCITED</p>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post from 2007 was migrated from my old blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://ifeelasleep.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;I FEEL&#xA;ASLEEP&lt;/a&gt;, which was shared with&#xA;Neverhitboxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Things I&#39;ve learned today&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I played through &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; today with a friend, start to finish, and I have to&#xA;say, I kinda don’t like it at all. I loved &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt; was great; but &lt;em&gt;Halo&#xA;3&lt;/em&gt;…meh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m a big storyline person. I love getting involved in the events of a game. A&#xA;big reason I bought the game (I don’t even have a 360 and had to get a friend to&#xA;lend his to me under the sole condition that I &lt;em&gt;give him the game&lt;/em&gt; when I’m&#xA;done) was to get some closure for the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; storyline, and frankly, &lt;em&gt;there is&#xA;none&lt;/em&gt;. There are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; questions left unanswered at the end of the game; too&#xA;many even if there were to be a &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t want to get too into specifics&#xA;for those who haven’t yet played through it and still plan to, but were it not&#xA;for a few small things, the game would have almost no attracting storyline&#xA;elements &lt;em&gt;whatsoever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I admit that some parts of the game were fun, namely the last level, which was&#xA;reminiscent of the first game’s last level &lt;em&gt;The Maw&lt;/em&gt;, but overall the game failed&#xA;to impress. The graphics were not at all bad, but weren’t something to drool&#xA;over (then again, we were playing split-screen on a 19-inch TV). I’d much prefer&#xA;not necessarily the graphics, but maybe the graphical feel of Wii’s Metroid&#xA;Prime 3, my last favorite console game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a separate but related note, playing console FPS’s constantly makes me&#xA;realize how much I love PC games. It seems trivial, but when you’re in an&#xA;intense situation, and you need to turn 180 degrees around, and with a console&#xA;you can only push the control stick so far in one direction and actually have to&#xA;&lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for your character to turn all the way around, it gets pretty annoying&#xA;and sets some serious pace limits. On a PC, you’re in full control &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; your&#xA;character’s movements actually &lt;em&gt;correspond&lt;/em&gt; to your mouse; there’s no center&#xA;that you need to reset to when you’re done turning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is hard to understand, just think about what I said &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; imagine you’re&#xA;playing &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; right now (or just go play it), and you want to spin around to&#xA;face the other way. You hold the control stick down one direction until you’re&#xA;there, right? It might take a second or less (depending on your sensitivity).&#xA;Now imagine the same situation on a PC. You just go &lt;em&gt;VRRP!&lt;/em&gt; and you’re there&#xA;(yes, that’s my sound effect for a mouse).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;anyways&lt;/strong&gt;, some PC games I’m excited for now are &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2:&#xA;Episode 2&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve already been playing the &lt;em&gt;Team Fortress 2&lt;/em&gt; beta and it’s pretty&#xA;freaking sweet (they’ve even implemented rankings, just like BF2/2142!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this time going completely off-topic: did you know &lt;em&gt;fell&lt;/em&gt; is a word!? I&#xA;don’t mean the past tense of &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt;; I mean you can actually go &lt;em&gt;fell&lt;/em&gt; something&#xA;(i.e. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ninjawords.com/fell&#34;&gt;felled&lt;/a&gt; that tree yesterday!). Woo, good&#xA;times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ugh, I could totally follow that up with an&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender&#34;&gt;ATLA&lt;/a&gt; quote…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

<h1>Things I've learned today</h1>

<p>So I played through <em>Halo 3</em> today with a friend, start to finish, and I have to
say, I kinda don’t like it at all. I loved <em>Halo</em>; <em>Halo 2</em> was great; but <em>Halo
3</em>…meh.</p>

<p>I’m a big storyline person. I love getting involved in the events of a game. A
big reason I bought the game (I don’t even have a 360 and had to get a friend to
lend his to me under the sole condition that I <em>give him the game</em> when I’m
done) was to get some closure for the <em>Halo</em> storyline, and frankly, <em>there is
none</em>. There are <em>so many</em> questions left unanswered at the end of the game; too
many even if there were to be a <em>Halo 4</em>. I don’t want to get too into specifics
for those who haven’t yet played through it and still plan to, but were it not
for a few small things, the game would have almost no attracting storyline
elements <em>whatsoever</em>.</p>

<p>I admit that some parts of the game were fun, namely the last level, which was
reminiscent of the first game’s last level <em>The Maw</em>, but overall the game failed
to impress. The graphics were not at all bad, but weren’t something to drool
over (then again, we were playing split-screen on a 19-inch TV). I’d much prefer
not necessarily the graphics, but maybe the graphical feel of Wii’s Metroid
Prime 3, my last favorite console game.</p>

<p>On a separate but related note, playing console FPS’s constantly makes me
realize how much I love PC games. It seems trivial, but when you’re in an
intense situation, and you need to turn 180 degrees around, and with a console
you can only push the control stick so far in one direction and actually have to
<em>wait</em> for your character to turn all the way around, it gets pretty annoying
and sets some serious pace limits. On a PC, you’re in full control <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> your
character’s movements actually <em>correspond</em> to your mouse; there’s no center
that you need to reset to when you’re done turning.</p>

<p>If this is hard to understand, just think about what I said <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> imagine you’re
playing <em>Halo</em> right now (or just go play it), and you want to spin around to
face the other way. You hold the control stick down one direction until you’re
there, right? It might take a second or less (depending on your sensitivity).
Now imagine the same situation on a PC. You just go <em>VRRP!</em> and you’re there
(yes, that’s my sound effect for a mouse).</p>

<p>So <strong>anyways</strong>, some PC games I’m excited for now are <em>Portal</em> and <em>Half-Life 2:
Episode 2</em>. I’ve already been playing the <em>Team Fortress 2</em> beta and it’s pretty
freaking sweet (they’ve even implemented rankings, just like BF2/2142!).</p>

<p>And this time going completely off-topic: did you know <em>fell</em> is a word!? I
don’t mean the past tense of <em>fall</em>; I mean you can actually go <em>fell</em> something
(i.e. I <a href="https://ninjawords.com/fell">felled</a> that tree yesterday!). Woo, good
times.</p>

<p>Ugh, I could totally follow that up with an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">ATLA</a> quote…</p>

      <title>Battlefield 2142</title>
      <link>https://twos.dev/2142.html.html</link>

But I’ve been playing&#xA;Battlefield 2142 lately and it’s pretty freaking sweet. I don’t care what the&#xA;ratings said when it came out; I have lots of fun playing it, just like I did&#xA;with BF1942 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the thing that’s so hooking (I say hooking and not addicting because&#xA;whenever a game is “addicting”, people freak out and send you to rehabilitation)&#xA;about games like 2142 is the ranking system. Needn’t I say, it’s the same deal&#xA;with MMORPG’s &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; it’s the feel of being rewarded. It’s what helps you get through&#xA;the not-so-fun but still not-so-horrible parts of the game like grinding &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; the&#xA;thought that it’s all worth it because next level you get so-and-so new spell,&#xA;or next promotion you get to choose a new weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I admit that it’s a shortcut to hooking people in (a game that’s good at heart&#xA;should be fun all the time no matter what), but I don’t disrespect any companies&#xA;for taking it, because hey &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; it’s a tough crowd, and if you can make a game that&#xA;people will play, that’s what you do. Plus, it’s not so different than real life&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; work hard and you will be rewarded. Not that I’m saying games should be like&#xA;life, because that’s the opposite of why we play them &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; but it’s just not as&#xA;crazy a concept as we might think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, to reward you for reading this far into the post (or maybe for just&#xA;scrolling past this cah-RAHZY blob of text you saw), here’s an&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://xkcd.com/&#34;&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt; comic. I love these comics’ relations to math and&#xA;intellect without losing ties to pure humor (assuming you can get the comic).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img &#34;&#34; &#34;xkcd&#34; &#34;&#34; }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

<h1>Battlefield 2142</h1>

<p>Not to say that I endorse war, or believe it to be fun. But I’ve been playing
Battlefield 2142 lately and it’s pretty freaking sweet. I don’t care what the
ratings said when it came out; I have lots of fun playing it, just like I did
with BF1942 and 2.</p>

<p>I think the thing that’s so hooking (I say hooking and not addicting because
whenever a game is “addicting”, people freak out and send you to rehabilitation)
about games like 2142 is the ranking system. Needn’t I say, it’s the same deal
with MMORPG’s <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it’s the feel of being rewarded. It’s what helps you get through
the not-so-fun but still not-so-horrible parts of the game like grinding <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> the
thought that it’s all worth it because next level you get so-and-so new spell,
or next promotion you get to choose a new weapon.</p>

<p>I admit that it’s a shortcut to hooking people in (a game that’s good at heart
should be fun all the time no matter what), but I don’t disrespect any companies
for taking it, because hey <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> it’s a tough crowd, and if you can make a game that
people will play, that’s what you do. Plus, it’s not so different than real life
<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> work hard and you will be rewarded. Not that I’m saying games should be like
life, because that’s the opposite of why we play them <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span> but it’s just not as
crazy a concept as we might think.</p>

<p>Speaking of, to reward you for reading this far into the post (or maybe for just
scrolling past this cah-RAHZY blob of text you saw), here’s an
<a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> comic. I love these comics’ relations to math and
intellect without losing ties to pure humor (assuming you can get the comic).</p>
