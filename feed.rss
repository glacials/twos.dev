      <title>Inside twos.dev</title>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Inside twos.dev&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a unique advantage in working on twos.dev over anything I’ve worked on: it has just one developer, me. I can therefore design the developer experience in obnoxious and unintuitive ways to serve my peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I decided to ruthlessly optimize for two goals:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must be easy to publish writing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As long as I&#39;m alive, URLs must not change&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some ways these goals work against each other; easy creation usually means easy destruction. So I divide my content into two types, warm and cold. Warm content is easy to create and edit, while cold content is hard to break.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Warm Content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used to write drafts in my notes app then migrate to HTML when the piece became less amorphous; from then on I would write and edit directly in HTML. This was surprisingly refreshing as it allowed me to have wild one-off customizations for individual posts, but it had three problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Writing HTML is a rough context switch (what was scribbling drafts on my phone became sitting at my computer in &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Writing was slowed down by cruft like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;li&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reading experience can flow differently on a web page than in a notes app, leading to large rewrites after transferring&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To solve these issues and work towards my first goal, I needed tooling in the space between amorphous notes and strict HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first focused on changing my drafting app to something with more robust exporting tools. I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://ia.net/writer&#34;&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt;, which has been great to get my thoughts out quickly. It  looks nice and has tools for reducing filler words and cliches. Importantly, it stores writing as Markdown files in an online drive of my choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;iOS and macOS ship with &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752&#34;&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, a no-code event-driven automation app. Using Shortcuts, I set up an automation that triggers when I switch away from the iA Writer app. The automation adds a 1-2 line YAML frontmatter section to each document, then pushes it to the &lt;code&gt;src/warm&lt;/code&gt; directory in the twos.dev Git repository by invoking &lt;a href=&#34;https://workingcopyapp.com&#34;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On push, GitHub Actions builds the Markdown file into HTML with all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/main/cmd/build_document.go&#34;&gt;right preprocessing&lt;/a&gt; required to make it look like twos.dev. I use a small subset of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.go.dev/html/template&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;html/template&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to allow myself to put things like MP4 screen recordings and dark-mode-aware images into Markdown. This is also where the frontmatter from before is stripped and parsed into metadata inserted elsewhere on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically at this point the page is now published, just not linked to from anywhere. I can see how it looks in the context of twos.dev, and send the link to friends who have offered to review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cold Content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 2-3 needs warm content doesn&#39;t cover: first, this odd pipeline that uses my phone for CI is not something I yet have high confidence in, so I&#39;d like to limit its exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, once in a while I need some wacky one-off piece of code code for a single post, like the CSS-only spectrum in &lt;a href=&#34;autism.html&#34;&gt;Anonymously Autistic&lt;/a&gt; or the variable-width font requirements of &lt;a href=&#34;dashes.html&#34;&gt;Dashes&lt;/a&gt;. iA Writer is great for prose, but when it&#39;s time to write code I need to be back in &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish these two needs I simply migrate the file out of iA Writer and into a plain directory meant for these pages that have &#34;graduated&#34;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git mv src/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;warm,cold&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/DOCUMENT.md&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From here I may also take one final step of permanently converting the document to HTML if I find myself building more than a little code into it.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>Inside twos.dev</h1>

<p>There's a unique advantage in working on twos.dev over anything I’ve worked on: it has just one developer, me. I can therefore design the developer experience in obnoxious and unintuitive ways to serve my peculiarities.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to ruthlessly optimize for two goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>It must be easy to publish writing</li>
<li>As long as I'm alive, URLs must not change</li>
</ol>

<p>In some ways these goals work against each other; easy creation usually means easy destruction. So I divide my content into two types, warm and cold. Warm content is easy to create and edit, while cold content is hard to break.</p>

<h2>Warm Content</h2>

<p>I used to write drafts in my notes app then migrate to HTML when the piece became less amorphous; from then on I would write and edit directly in HTML. This was surprisingly refreshing as it allowed me to have wild one-off customizations for individual posts, but it had three problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing HTML is a rough context switch (what was scribbling drafts on my phone became sitting at my computer in <code>$EDITOR</code>)</li>
<li>Writing was slowed down by cruft like <code>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;</code> and <code>&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;</code></li>
<li>The reading experience can flow differently on a web page than in a notes app, leading to large rewrites after transferring</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve these issues and work towards my first goal, I needed tooling in the space between amorphous notes and strict HTML.</p>

<p>I first focused on changing my drafting app to something with more robust exporting tools. I found <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, which has been great to get my thoughts out quickly. It  looks nice and has tools for reducing filler words and cliches. Importantly, it stores writing as Markdown files in an online drive of my choosing.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>iOS and macOS ship with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752">Shortcuts</a>, a no-code event-driven automation app. Using Shortcuts, I set up an automation that triggers when I switch away from the iA Writer app. The automation adds a 1-2 line YAML frontmatter section to each document, then pushes it to the <code>src/warm</code> directory in the twos.dev Git repository by invoking <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>.</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>

<p>On push, GitHub Actions builds the Markdown file into HTML with all the <a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/main/cmd/build_document.go">right preprocessing</a> required to make it look like twos.dev. I use a small subset of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/html/template"><code>html/template</code></a> to allow myself to put things like MP4 screen recordings and dark-mode-aware images into Markdown. This is also where the frontmatter from before is stripped and parsed into metadata inserted elsewhere on the page.</p>

<p>Technically at this point the page is now published, just not linked to from anywhere. I can see how it looks in the context of twos.dev, and send the link to friends who have offered to review.</p>

<h2>Cold Content</h2>

<p>There are 2-3 needs warm content doesn't cover: first, this odd pipeline that uses my phone for CI is not something I yet have high confidence in, so I'd like to limit its exposure.</p>

<p>Second, once in a while I need some wacky one-off piece of code code for a single post, like the CSS-only spectrum in <a href="autism.html">Anonymously Autistic</a> or the variable-width font requirements of <a href="dashes.html">Dashes</a>. iA Writer is great for prose, but when it's time to write code I need to be back in <code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>

<p>To accomplish these two needs I simply migrate the file out of iA Writer and into a plain directory meant for these pages that have "graduated":</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">git mv src/<span class="o">{</span>warm,cold<span class="o">}</span>/DOCUMENT.md
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>From here I may also take one final step of permanently converting the document to HTML if I find myself building more than a little code into it. This gives me autoformatting and syntax highlighting, and hardens the file against future changes to preprocessing.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">twos.dev build
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">mv dist/DOCUMENT.html src/cold/DOCUMENT.md
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">git mv src/cold/DOCUMENT.<span class="o">{</span>md,html<span class="o">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>This brings back the weight of editing prose in HTML, but these cases are the minority and at this point most of the writing is done anyway.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Allowing myself this escape hatch is freeing. I’m more encouraged to write interactive or otherwise bespoke components, and twos.dev becomes consistent by default but I can break that consistency when I need (e.g. for a <a href="cv.html">CV</a>'s bicolumnar layout).</p>

<h2>On URLs Not Changing</h2>

<p>I use my website as a test bed for interesting technology. As a side effect, content has been lost over the years as it becomes hard to migrate to overhauled versions.</p>

<p>It so happens that by keeping my writing in Markdown or raw HTML/CSS, I make it easy to accomplish my second goal: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URLs don’t change</a>. I've removed the possibility that changing frontend or backend frameworks will leave my documents behind; Markdown is not going anywhere, and all the HTML files need to look decent is a header and footer. In the worst case scenario I'll simply <code>cp -r dist</code> to my next crazy system's web root.</p>

<p>If I’ve done things right, this web page will be accessible at twos.dev/meta.html for at least as long as I live.</p>

This is... almost true. The confusing correction is that an em dash is so named because it is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; wide. Incidentally, the en is defined as half of one em; much of my focus will be on the em.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Em&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To talk about the em dash necessitates talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)&#34;&gt;em&lt;/a&gt;. The em (pronounced &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation&#34;&gt;/ɛm/&lt;/a&gt;) is an invisible bounding box every character is designed within&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:boundingbox&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:boundingbox&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; whose edge length is equal to the font height. Font height changes with font size, so the size of the em changes with it: &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; is always one &lt;em&gt;font-heighth&lt;/em&gt; long. It is a unitless measurement that allows us to speak in relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in ems, it follows, is functionally equivalent to speaking in font size percentages. A font size in ems is a ratio between the desired font size and the current font size. The CSS declaration &lt;code&gt;font-size: 1em&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;font-size: 100%&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;1.5em&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;150%&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em&#39;s eccentric offering is that it can be used outside the context of font sizes. It can set margins, widths, even blur radii based on the font size of the containing context. It can scale an image up and down with the text around it, whether the text&#39;s changing size is a product of assistive technologies or simply of a component being reused in multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The em came about in the times of the printing press, when every &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type was large and perfectly square, thus convenient to use as a proportional measurement for a given font and size. When the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type eventually rebelled against being square, the modern em shifted its definition to the remaining constant, the height. At the time this was effectively a non-change, but the updated definition allowed the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; and the em to be decoupled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;The Em Dash&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the tailwind given by the definition of the em, the em dash is easily defined: a dash that is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; long. In a way, the em dash took up the mantle of the square &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; type. Because the em dash is &lt;code&gt;1em&lt;/code&gt; long, and the em is defined as the height of the font, the em dash&#39;s bounding box is an exact square&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;in any font, at any size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;The Root Em&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;root em&lt;/strong&gt; is a twist on the em. It is relative not to the parent context&#39;s font size, but to the root context&#39;s (in a web page, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). This allows one to escape relativity hell without reverting to absolutes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;html: 16pt              (default     = 16pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  → body: 1.5em         (16pt * 1.5  = 24pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    → .container: .75em (24pt *  .75 = 18pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      → h1: 4em         (18pt * 4    = 72pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      → p: 1em          (18pt * 1    = 18pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    → footer: 0.5rem    (16pt * 0.5  =  8pt)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;key:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt; 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;context: requested size (calculation = final size)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  → child element&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Aside: The Point&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to define the em in terms of points without defining the point. The point has had a tumultuous and unstandardized history both physically and digitally, but today the world has predominantly settled on &lt;code&gt;1/72in&lt;/code&gt; per point. This varies greatly among displays, devices, and assistive technologies; for example, a 21” 1440p display has more pixels per inch than a 27” 1440p display. To wrangle the variability, there exist new unstandardized concepts like &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskUseDP&#34;&gt;density-independent pixels&lt;/a&gt; on Android and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design#effective-pixels-and-scale-factor&#34;&gt;effective pixels&lt;/a&gt; on Windows. The tumultuous history, as it happens, hasn&#39;t ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the displays I develop on, I’ve settled on a rough mental framework of “1px of em length per pt” because it’s close enough to true and easy to remember: a 16pt font has a 16px em and is therefore 16px high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advanced usage of dashes unfortunately revolves around avoiding common issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Em Dash Overuse&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a personal opinion, the em dash tends to be a trap to a new writer. It is sympathetic to stream-of-consciousness writing, wherein the writer is in &#34;append-only&#34; mode&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;thinking not of the structure of the sentence but of what new words may clarify it when tacked on. For people whose writings spring from internal monologues this seems a neat way to avoid adding structure to organic thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organic thoughts have their place in writing, but it turns out spending time perfecting sentence structure pays dividends to the reader. Long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. Because the pre-dash thought may continue post-dash, the reader must keep its grammar and intention in an internal buffer, which&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;can be hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the em dash is a large glyph and hard to go unnoticed. Its use is obvious even in peripheral vision, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page before reading it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Belittled Hyphens&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like &#34;frozen yogurt&#34; its spaces can visually overpower the hyphen: &lt;code&gt;pre-frozen yogurt&lt;/code&gt; looks like &lt;code&gt;[pre-frozen] yogurt&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;pre-[frozen yogurt]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One solution replaces spaces with hyphens (&lt;code&gt;pre-frozen-yogurt&lt;/code&gt;), which may or may not suit the hyphenation. The opposite (&lt;code&gt;pre frozen yogurt&lt;/code&gt;) is another tool in the bag, but the best it can do is shift ambiguity, not remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\LaTeX\)&lt;/span&gt; users can replace each space with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\thinspace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to de-emphasize them relative to hyphens, though the difference is subtle enough that you may also consider elongating nearby spaces:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a pre-frozen&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\thinspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;yogurt time&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\enspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;pre-frozen&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\thinspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;yogurt&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;\enspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;time&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\text{a pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt time}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\text{a\enspace{}pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt\enspace{}time}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, the most common tool I reach for is to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;a time before frozen yogurt&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s crude, but dependable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Broken Dashes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It&#39;s accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being introduced to join a word split across lines. En and em dashes are a little harder to parse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;v left page edge             v right page edge&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;|                            |&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;I am looking at dates about 20&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;30 days out.&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;

}}</p>

<p>There are three common dashes in written English:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyphen : <span style="“font-family:sans-serif”">-</span></li>
<li>En dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span></li>
<li>Em dash: <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The hyphen is used to join words, prefixes, and/or suffixes together, like father-in-law.</p>

<p>The en dash is used to create ranges, like 2020<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2030.</p>

<p>The em dash can be used as a more powerful parenthetical, a replacement for a colon, or to represent an interruption of a speaker.</p>

<h2>One Size Doesn't Fit All</h2>

<p>A myth states the em dash is so named because it is "one <code>M</code> wide", and the en dash "one <code>N</code> wide". This is... almost true. The confusing correction is that an em dash is so named because it is <code>1em</code> wide. Incidentally, the en is defined as half of one em; much of my focus will be on the em.</p>

<h3>The Em</h3>

<p>To talk about the em dash necessitates talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)">em</a>. The em (pronounced <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation">/ɛm/</a>) is an invisible bounding box every character is designed within<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:boundingbox"><a href="#fn:boundingbox">1</a></sup> whose edge length is equal to the font height. Font height changes with font size, so the size of the em changes with it: <code>1em</code> is always one <em>font-heighth</em> long. It is a unitless measurement that allows us to speak in relatives.</p>

<p>Speaking in ems, it follows, is functionally equivalent to speaking in font size percentages. A font size in ems is a ratio between the desired font size and the current font size. The CSS declaration <code>font-size: 1em</code> is equivalent to <code>font-size: 100%</code>, while <code>1.5em</code> is equivalent to <code>150%</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>The em's eccentric offering is that it can be used outside the context of font sizes. It can set margins, widths, even blur radii based on the font size of the containing context. It can scale an image up and down with the text around it, whether the text's changing size is a product of assistive technologies or simply of a component being reused in multiple contexts.</p>

<p>The em came about in the times of the printing press, when every <code>M</code> type was large and perfectly square, thus convenient to use as a proportional measurement for a given font and size. When the <code>M</code> type eventually rebelled against being square, the modern em shifted its definition to the remaining constant, the height. At the time this was effectively a non-change, but the updated definition allowed the <code>M</code> and the em to be decoupled.</p>

<h4>The Em Dash</h4>

<p>With the tailwind given by the definition of the em, the em dash is easily defined: a dash that is <code>1em</code> long. In a way, the em dash took up the mantle of the square <code>M</code> type. Because the em dash is <code>1em</code> long, and the em is defined as the height of the font, the em dash's bounding box is an exact square<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>in any font, at any size.</p>

<h4>The Root Em</h4>

<p>The <code>rem</code> or <strong>root em</strong> is a twist on the em. It is relative not to the parent context's font size, but to the root context's (in a web page, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>). This allows one to escape relativity hell without reverting to absolutes:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="cl">html: 16pt              (default     = 16pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 2</span><span class="cl">  → body: 1.5em         (16pt * 1.5  = 24pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 3</span><span class="cl">    → .container: .75em (24pt *  .75 = 18pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 4</span><span class="cl">      → h1: 4em         (18pt * 4    = 72pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 5</span><span class="cl">      → p: 1em          (18pt * 1    = 18pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 6</span><span class="cl">    → footer: 0.5rem    (16pt * 0.5  =  8pt)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 7</span><span class="cl">      
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 8</span><span class="cl">key:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 9</span><span class="cl">context: requested size (calculation = final size)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">10</span><span class="cl">  → child element
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<h4>Aside: The Point</h4>

<p>It’s hard to define the em in terms of points without defining the point. The point has had a tumultuous and unstandardized history both physically and digitally, but today the world has predominantly settled on <code>1/72in</code> per point. This varies greatly among displays, devices, and assistive technologies; for example, a 21” 1440p display has more pixels per inch than a 27” 1440p display. To wrangle the variability, there exist new unstandardized concepts like <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskUseDP">density-independent pixels</a> on Android and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design#effective-pixels-and-scale-factor">effective pixels</a> on Windows. The tumultuous history, as it happens, hasn't ended.</p>

<p>Based on the displays I develop on, I’ve settled on a rough mental framework of “1px of em length per pt” because it’s close enough to true and easy to remember: a 16pt font has a 16px em and is therefore 16px high.</p>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<p>Advanced usage of dashes unfortunately revolves around avoiding common issues.</p>

<h3>Em Dash Overuse</h3>

<p>As a personal opinion, the em dash tends to be a trap to a new writer. It is sympathetic to stream-of-consciousness writing, wherein the writer is in "append-only" mode<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>thinking not of the structure of the sentence but of what new words may clarify it when tacked on. For people whose writings spring from internal monologues this seems a neat way to avoid adding structure to organic thoughts.</p>

<p>Organic thoughts have their place in writing, but it turns out spending time perfecting sentence structure pays dividends to the reader. Long flowing thoughts connected by em dashes take mental effort to keep up with. Because the pre-dash thought may continue post-dash, the reader must keep its grammar and intention in an internal buffer, which<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>for example, if the author decides to describe something tangential or dive into an example to assist with understanding, hoping their explanation can let the rest of the sentence off the hook but ultimately making the reader do more work to understand it<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>can be hard to do.</p>

<p>Separately, the em dash is a large glyph and hard to go unnoticed. Its use is obvious even in peripheral vision, so its overuse becomes a stain on the page before reading it.</p>

<h3>Belittled Hyphens</h3>

<p>When one side of a hyphen is a compound word like "frozen yogurt" its spaces can visually overpower the hyphen: <code>pre-frozen yogurt</code> looks like <code>[pre-frozen] yogurt</code>, not <code>pre-[frozen yogurt]</code>.</p>

<p>One solution replaces spaces with hyphens (<code>pre-frozen-yogurt</code>), which may or may not suit the hyphenation. The opposite (<code>pre frozen yogurt</code>) is another tool in the bag, but the best it can do is shift ambiguity, not remove it.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> users can replace each space with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_space"><code>\thinspace</code></a> to de-emphasize them relative to hyphens, though the difference is subtle enough that you may also consider elongating nearby spaces:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt time
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">a<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>pre-frozen<span class="k">\thinspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>yogurt<span class="k">\enspace</span><span class="nb">{}</span>time
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{a pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt time}\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[\text{a\enspace{}pre-frozen\thinspace{}yogurt\enspace{}time}\]</span></p><p>Personally, the most common tool I reach for is to restructure the sentence to avoid the problem:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">a time before frozen yogurt
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>It's crude, but dependable.</p>

<h3>Broken Dashes</h3>

<p>If a line soft-wraps immediately before or after a dash, what should its behavior be? It's accepted that a hyphen can appear as the last character on a line, whether it was already there or is being introduced to join a word split across lines. En and em dashes are a little harder to parse.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge             v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">I am looking at dates about 20
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>30 days out.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm looking at dates about 20<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">30 days out.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I am pleased they thought that
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>however odd it may be.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I'm pleased they thought that<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">however odd it may be.
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>Strangely, the hyphen is the only dash that has an option here: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Non-breaking_hyphens">non-breaking hyphen</a> or "hard hyphen" is a hyphen glyph that sends a signal to the word wrapper that a wrap must not happen after it.</p>

<h3>Drowned Dashes</h3>

<p>When using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified">justified text</a> elongated spaces can overpower dashes where non-elongated spaces would not have.</p>

<p>For example, see this simulation of left-aligned text:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge             v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">I said they were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">playdates don't last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>And this simulation of justified text:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I    said    they   were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">playdates don't last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>In the justified simulation, "were<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>wolf" reads like the mythical creature "were-wolf" because the spaces are proportionally larger than the em dash.</p>

<p>A solution surrounds each parenthetical em dash with a space on either side, causing its total width to scale up at twice the rate of spaces:</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">|                            |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">I   said  they  were  <span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>  wolf
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">playdates don't last forever!
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<h3>Input Difficulties</h3>

<p>Standard US keyboards support only the hyphen, so many en and em dash users simply compose them from hyphens and spaces.</p>

<p>No one should ever fault that, but for those who are willing to commit something new to memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>macOS

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>⌥ + -</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>⌥ + Shift + -</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows

<ul>
<li>En dash: <code>Alt + 0150</code></li>
<li>Em dash: <code>Alt + 0151</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For all others, read on.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered En Dash</h4>

<p>The en dash looks similar enough to the hyphen in most fonts that people often settle for a single hyphen: <code>2020-2030</code>. <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> requires two (<code>--</code>) for the en dash.</p>

<h4>The Hyphen-Powered Em Dash</h4>

<p>A common replacement for the em dash is a space on either end of two hyphens (<code>--</code>). Because <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> reserves two hyphens for the en dash, it requires three (<code>---</code>) for the em.</p>

<h3>Output Difficulties</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, twos.dev renders in a monospaced font for aesthetic reasons. Unfortunately, the glyphs for many dashes are virtually indistinguishable in monospaced fonts. To make the differences visible, I wrote [a bespoke preprocessing step(<a href="https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/a61379f9c0f121e9e98033c2a32c3ef47f975f48/winter/document.go#L41-L47">https://github.com/glacials/twos.dev/blob/a61379f9c0f121e9e98033c2a32c3ef47f975f48/winter/document.go#L41-L47</a>) to render twos.dev's dashes in a variable width font.</p>

<p>I'd love for there to be a "monospace with exceptions" font that takes this chore out of my hands.</p>

<h2>Bonus Round: Esoteric Dashes</h2>

<p>The hyphen, en dash, and em dash get all the love, but behind the scenes are a silent majority of dashes that don't often get to see the light of day.</p>

<p>The <strong>swung dash</strong> (<span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>) is an elongated tilde used to stand in for a word being defined in a dictionary.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:swung"><a href="#fn:swung">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>boot (n)</p>

<p>ex: Let me put on my other <span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁓</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>horizontal bar</strong> is a way to introduce quotations. Confusingly, its length is almost always identical to the em dash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">―</span> O Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!</p>

<p><em>James Joyce's Ulysses p. 335</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>hyphen bullet</strong> is a hyphen to be used in place of a bullet point.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">- This is a hyphen
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">⁃</span> This is a hyphen bullet
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>The <strong>figure dash</strong> is a variant of the en dash having the same width as digits (which are uniformly wide in most fonts). It is meant for phone numbers and other numeric contexts where columnar alignment is required or pleasing.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">Figure dash: 867‒5309
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">Number:      86705309
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">En dash:     867<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>5309
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">Hyphen:      867-5309
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>Lastly, my favorite: the <strong>soft hyphen</strong> is a zero-width, invisible character that (opposite to the hard hyphen) denotes a place the word wrapper is <em>welcome</em> to wrap. This can be used in the middle of a compound word or long line of inert code to provide a cleaner wrap.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">v left page edge            v right page edge
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">|                           |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">No soft hyphen:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">4</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilisticexpialid-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">5</span><span class="cl">ocious
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">6</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">7</span><span class="cl">Soft hyphen after 'istic':
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">8</span><span class="cl">Supercalifragilistic-
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">9</span><span class="cl">expialidocious
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

I like to&#xA;click into their pranks to see where the seam is. Are they &#34;launching a&#xA;new product&#34; but the only page to be found is a press release? Or, is&#xA;there a product page with a disabled Buy button? Sometimes the Buy button&#xA;works, but brings you to a page that says &#34;Fooled you!&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was never satisfied by these seams after witnessing first-hand the gold wacky&#xA;standard: On April 1, 2004, a popular search engine pranked that it was pivoting&#xA;into becoming an email service -- and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html&#34;&gt;it&#xA;did&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;This was especially surprising in the age before every startup was a data&#xA;company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Gmail was not created to remove a seam from an April Fool&#39;s Day&#xA;prank. It was made independently from April Fool’s Day, and someone decided it&#xA;would be funny to disguise its launch as a prank. But as a bystander the&#xA;effect is the same: it seems that they are calling their own bluffs. There&#39;s&#xA;no &#34;Fooled you!&#34; page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Calling Your Own Bluffs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always wanted more experiences like this, so I built one. I run a website&#xA;called &lt;a href=&#34;https://splits.io&#34;&gt;Splits.io&lt;/a&gt; whose goal is to help&#xA;speedrunners (people who time themselves playing video games) play faster.&#xA;It&#39;s a niche site, but we have paying customers and about 10k monthly active&#xA;users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For April Fool&#39;s Day in 2020, we launched a full-page takeover introducing a&#xA;feature to help people speedrun faster: the urgent need to use the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We joked that we would ship them a spicy hot sauce which they could use as a&#xA;sort of gastrointestinal negative reinforcement. But when people clicked Buy,&#xA;they did not see &#34;Fooled you!&#34;, but a form to enter their payment&#xA;information. And when they entered their payment information and pressed&#xA;submit, they received a receipt in their inbox. And a charge to their card. A&#xA;week later, a package would show up at their door.&#xA;We called all our bluffs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted people to receive real hot sauce, and I knew it couldn&#39;t just&#xA;be any hot sauce from the grocery store. The April Fool&#39;s takeover was going&#xA;to advertise a Splits.io-branded hot sauce, and we were going to give it to&#xA;them. I called it &lt;em&gt;Race to the Bottom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Sauce&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t want to deal with actually making or bottling a product like hot&#xA;sauce but you still want one sporting your own brand, the main option is to&#xA;work with a&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;white label&lt;/strong&gt; company, i.e. one that does every step of making a&#xA;traditional product except for the branding. Instead of selling to consumers&#xA;or retailers, they sell to those with a brand and nothing else. This could be&#xA;someone who&#39;s just amazing at branding and needs a supplier, or it could be&#xA;your employer making some commemorative swag, or it could be an engineer&#xA;trying to make a dumb April Fool&#39;s Day joke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A surprising number of household brands use white label products behind the&#xA;scenes, namely store brands. Because the customers of these white label&#xA;companies are often large businesses, there&#39;s not a pressing need for&#xA;self-service like in consumer retail. That means it can take some phone tag&#xA;and email threads to get the relationship hammered out. But still, it works --&#xA;19% of the US economy is made up of white label goods&#xA;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/topics/1076/private-label-market/#topicHeader__wrapper&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily the last few years have seen some self-service white label products&#xA;enter the market, propelled I think by the demand for startup swag. For&#xA;something as niche as hot sauce, though, the best we could hope for was&#xA;partial automation. I engaged with several vendors and ordered sample packs&#xA;from two -- one via self-service for $25 and one via phone call for free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I made some chips, invited some friends over (pre-pandemic), and got to&#xA;work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;  &#34;Taste testing hot sauces.&#34;&#xA;  &#34;trialing&#34;&#xA;  &#34;several hot sauce bottles around a plate, with part of each bottle poured into a spot on the plate that allows for dipping&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We selected a hot sauce called Pale Ale Chipotle and the company rated its&#xA;spiciness as 8/10 (no Scoville rating).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Label&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re a small team with no designer, so I cracked open Acorn and spent way too&#xA;long making way too ugly a label.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;  &#34;The final label for Race to the Bottom.

So one year later, we suddenly got another influx of orders. Luckily I&#xA;still had plenty of stock with expiration dates still over a year away, so&#xA;spent a little surprise day packing hot sauce again -- and again a third time,&#xA;another year later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Finances&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the sample packs and the bulk order of 48 bottles (the minimum), upfront&#xA;costs came to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(192.05.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>When the April Fool's Day Prank is Real</h1>

<p>I love it when companies call their own bluffs on April Fool's Day. I like to
click into their pranks to see where the seam is. Are they "launching a
new product" but the only page to be found is a press release? Or, is
there a product page with a disabled Buy button? Sometimes the Buy button
works, but brings you to a page that says "Fooled you!".</p>

<p>I was never satisfied by these seams after witnessing first-hand the gold wacky
standard: On April 1, 2004, a popular search engine pranked that it was pivoting
into becoming an email service -- and then <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html">it
did</a>.
This was especially surprising in the age before every startup was a data
company.</p>

<p>Of course, Gmail was not created to remove a seam from an April Fool's Day
prank. It was made independently from April Fool’s Day, and someone decided it
would be funny to disguise its launch as a prank. But as a bystander the
effect is the same: it seems that they are calling their own bluffs. There's
no "Fooled you!" page.</p>

<h2>Calling Your Own Bluffs</h2>

<p>I always wanted more experiences like this, so I built one. I run a website
called <a href="https://splits.io">Splits.io</a> whose goal is to help
speedrunners (people who time themselves playing video games) play faster.
It's a niche site, but we have paying customers and about 10k monthly active
users.</p>

<p>For April Fool's Day in 2020, we launched a full-page takeover introducing a
feature to help people speedrun faster: the urgent need to use the bathroom.</p>

<p>We joked that we would ship them a spicy hot sauce which they could use as a
sort of gastrointestinal negative reinforcement. But when people clicked Buy,
they did not see "Fooled you!", but a form to enter their payment
information. And when they entered their payment information and pressed
submit, they received a receipt in their inbox. And a charge to their card. A
week later, a package would show up at their door.
We called all our bluffs.</p>

<h2>The Set Up</h2>

<p>I knew I wanted people to receive real hot sauce, and I knew it couldn't just
be any hot sauce from the grocery store. The April Fool's takeover was going
to advertise a Splits.io-branded hot sauce, and we were going to give it to
them. I called it <em>Race to the Bottom</em>.</p>

<h3>The Sauce</h3>

<p>If you don't want to deal with actually making or bottling a product like hot
sauce but you still want one sporting your own brand, the main option is to
work with a
<strong>white label</strong> company, i.e. one that does every step of making a
traditional product except for the branding. Instead of selling to consumers
or retailers, they sell to those with a brand and nothing else. This could be
someone who's just amazing at branding and needs a supplier, or it could be
your employer making some commemorative swag, or it could be an engineer
trying to make a dumb April Fool's Day joke.</p>

<p>A surprising number of household brands use white label products behind the
scenes, namely store brands. Because the customers of these white label
companies are often large businesses, there's not a pressing need for
self-service like in consumer retail. That means it can take some phone tag
and email threads to get the relationship hammered out. But still, it works --
19% of the US economy is made up of white label goods
(<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1076/private-label-market/#topicHeader__wrapper">source</a>).</p>

<p>Luckily the last few years have seen some self-service white label products
enter the market, propelled I think by the demand for startup swag. For
something as niche as hot sauce, though, the best we could hope for was
partial automation. I engaged with several vendors and ordered sample packs
from two -- one via self-service for $25 and one via phone call for free.</p>

<p>Then I made some chips, invited some friends over (pre-pandemic), and got to
work.</p>

<p>{{ img
  "Taste testing hot sauces."
  "trialing"
  "several hot sauce bottles around a plate, with part of each bottle poured into a spot on the plate that allows for dipping"
}}</p>

<p>We selected a hot sauce called Pale Ale Chipotle and the company rated its
spiciness as 8/10 (no Scoville rating).</p>

<h3>The Label</h3>

<p>We're a small team with no designer, so I cracked open Acorn and spent way too
long making way too ugly a label.</p>

<p>{{ img
  "The final label for Race to the Bottom. We were also trialing an energy drink, but scrapped it at the last minute."
  "label"
  "a hot sauce label reading 'Race to the bottom: A speedrunner's hot sauce' in the Splits.io colors"
}}</p>

<p>The white label company sent me a template with requirements such as how to
print the volume of the sauce within compliance, and the right proportions for
the label. They took care of the nutrition facts and bar code.</p>

<h2>Launch Day</h2>

<p>We set up everything to happen automatically. The code had been deployed days
earlier, with JavaScript just waiting for the day to tick over before doing
the takeover. The announcement tweet was scheduled ahead of time as well.
The response when the clock struck midnight was exactly as we hoped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>its actually real wtf</p>

  "feedback-1"
  "Screenshot a Discord channel where someone asks 'it is at this point that I begin to wonder how far I'll go for the meme, with a screenshot of them at the last step of the hot sauce payment flow, with an unclicked button that says 'Pay'. Below that, they say 'I had to know' and attached another screenshot of the order being completed. They then said 'this is gonna be like that movie Accepted where you accidentally make a clickable button on a fake website and then end up learning how to meet the demand, isn't it?'"

}}</p>

<h3>Shipping</h3>

<p>I went into this expecting to make bulk trips to the post office, but I
actually never had to leave the house -- usps.com allows you to schedule a
mail carrier to pick up packages during their mail route. I had padded
flat-rate envelopes ready, also delivered from their website. On April 1st,
here was my pipeline:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Trigger) Receive “payment completed” email from Stripe</li>
<li>Pay for a shipping label at usps.com (~$9)</li>
<li>Print shipping label, affix to a padded envelope with scotch tape</li>
<li>Pack in hot sauce and extra packing material</li>
<li>Schedule a pickup at usps.com</li>
<li>(On pickup day) Put queued package(s) on the porch</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Surprises</h2>

<p>I built the full-page takeover to check if the day was April 1 when deciding
whether to take over or lie dormant, but I didn't think about checking the
year. So one year later, we suddenly got another influx of orders. Luckily I
still had plenty of stock with expiration dates still over a year away, so
spent a little surprise day packing hot sauce again -- and again a third time,
another year later.</p>

<h2>Finances</h2>

<p>After the sample packs and the bulk order of 48 bottles (the minimum), upfront
costs came to <span class="math inline">\(192.05. Over three April Fool's Days we sold 28 bottles in 25
orders at \)</span>15 / bottle.</p>

<p>The cost of my labor and the boon to the brand are harder to calculate. I'll
call them a wash.</p>

<html><head></head><body><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="cl">Revenue
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 2</span><span class="cl">Orders: $15*28   =  $ 420.00
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 3</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 4</span><span class="cl">Costs
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 5</span><span class="cl">Samples:           ($  25.00)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 6</span><span class="cl">Hot sauce:         ($ 167.05)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 7</span><span class="cl">Shipping: $9*25  = ($ 225.00)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 8</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln"> 9</span><span class="cl">Profit/loss ----------------
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">10</span><span class="cl">                    $   2.95
</span></span></code></pre></body></html>

<p>I'll take it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Getting paid $2.95 to live out a minor dream of building a seamless April Fool's
Day joke was a great deal. I'd have paid a lot more just for the joy of seeing
people's reactions in real time.</p>

<p>On the way, I learned how white labels work and how big a slice of the economy
they make up, which has changed how I think about brands. Sometimes you have to
be a little wacky to learn something new about the world.</p>

The usual suspects sure---Gmail,&#xA;Photos, Chrome, etc.---but also the ones people stay away from---Tasks, Keep,&#xA;YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp;amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We&#xA;have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook,&#xA;the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the&#xA;“Google graveyard”. And for a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture&#xA;with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it&#39;s no surprise I’ve&#xA;been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is&#xA;how I understand why---or whether---I prefer what I chose. For Android, that&#xA;means trialing an iPhone. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&amp;amp;t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw&#34;&gt;I did&#xA;this&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;five years ago for a few months (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://bensw.com&#34;&gt;bensw&lt;/a&gt;), but&#xA;afterwards I thought &#34;It&#39;s actually not that different, it&#39;s just that the&#xA;Google apps don&#39;t feel native, so I’ll stick with Android&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&#39;ve realized it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition&#xA;without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the same reason Google apps&#xA;don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn&#39;t shine if you only use Google apps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an honest,&#xA;holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me out, but better to&#xA;trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know&#xA;one. These are my notes on hopping the fence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Broad Themes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I&#39;ll summarize&#xA;the themes I&#39;ve witnessed during them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;safety&#34;&gt;Safety vs. Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I&#39;d long ago published its&#xA;Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding denial after denial.&#xA;I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user, and I could see with fresh&#xA;eyes the effects of the strictness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating system. They&#xA;don&#39;t feel like they were written by others, and that makes me feel safe. My&#xA;data feels like part of my device, not part of Google. And I trust my device&#xA;to manage my payment, location, etc. data, because it is mine. I own it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight for it.&#xA;But it&#39;s a good feeling. And it only comes with control---control by a&#xA;representative I trust, over parties I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know app developers,&#xA;especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through them I can trust app&#xA;developers, but only because Apple so heavily controls what they can publish.&#xA;They can&#39;t send me to their sketchy site or use dark patterns to trick me into&#xA;paying them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don&#39;t feel safe, I have&#xA;the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I have &#34;the choice&#34; to do&#xA;a food safety inspection of every restaurant I visit, but I do not want to and&#xA;I wouldn&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking for, so I trust my local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go through&#xA;the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means Apple takes a cut&#xA;of everything. As a user, this means one central place where I can manage&#xA;(read: cancel) subscriptions---no digging through menus or talking to customer&#xA;service agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ imgs&#xA;   &#34;The App Store&#39;s subscriptions management menus.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;subscriptions&#34;&#xA;   &#34;Screenshot of iOS App Store showing multiple active subscriptions&#34;&#xA;   &#34;subscription&#34;&#xA;   &#34;iOS App Store showing options to change or cancel a subscription&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party auth&#xA;providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means building&#xA;another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this means I get a native,&#xA;one-tap, FaceID sign-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video &#34;Signing in with Apple.&#34; &#34;signin&#34; }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see the more&#xA;I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing &#34;public goods&#34;,&#xA;whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad clickthrough---data, eyeballs,&#xA;and engagement. Of course, this has its problems. Apple is a private company,&#xA;not elected officials, so is only as beholden to its end users as it wants to&#xA;be. For now, the incentives seem aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;offline&#34;&gt;Offline-first vs. Online-first Design&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in attitude&#xA;Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user identity. To&#xA;Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is just a window into that&#xA;account. The device may have some caching and synchronization to remain useful&#xA;offline, but ultimately Google&#39;s servers are the source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data between&#xA;multiple devices, but it&#39;s just that---synchronization. Apps usually wait until&#xA;the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you can even sync with a cable&#xA;(or not at all) instead of iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways these differences are expressed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Google wants a blurry line between web and native experiences; its official&#xA;apps are going the way of PWAs and similar tech that can be deployed to web&#xA;and app ~identically. In contrast Apple puts every major UX flow in a native&#xA;app, from email and calendar to bug reporting and account management. Even&#xA;uploading apps to the App Store for publishing---a fundamentally online&#xA;experience--is a native app.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Google Docs documents are rows in a database, where Apple Pages documents&#xA;are files on a filesystem; sharing and synchronization are handled by iCloud&#xA;which is more akin to Dropbox in this mode. It does support 100 simultaneous&#xA;writers, but I&#39;m not sure how.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a phone&#xA;number or email), not an Apple account---even if the bubble is blue. You may&#xA;be unknowingly using a combination of phone and email for one contact, because&#xA;iMessage silently interleaves them if they&#39;re owned by the same Apple account.&#xA;If that person later removes one from their Apple account, your iMessage&#xA;thread with them retroactively splits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call from your&#xA;computer, you&#39;re going through Google&#39;s servers. In the Apple ecosystem,&#xA;when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad, you&#39;re connecting&#xA;locally to your iPhone to route the call.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic&#xA;always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly&#xA;experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a machine&#xA;are centralized in iCloud settings where they&#39;re often off by default. I still&#xA;can&#39;t get one of my Safaris to synchronize its bookmarks with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;committment&#34;&gt;Committment vs. Experimentation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google is infamous for killing products. They release early, often, and in&#xA;isolation; see Hangouts and Allo, Meet and Duo, or Reminders and Tasks.&#xA;Innovation comes first and stablizing the product offering comes second, when&#xA;the product is proven (or not proven) to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple instead takes the &#34;measure twice, cut once&#34; approach; products are&#xA;rarely released and rarely killed. The iPod was around for 21 years,&#xA;co-existing with the iPhone for 12 of them. Apple Maps was a notoriously&#xA;failed app at launch in 2012 and still suffers from that reputational injury,&#xA;however &lt;em&gt;it&#39;s still around anyway&lt;/em&gt; and has improved drastically (although&#xA;whether enough is &lt;a href=&#34;#maps&#34;&gt;still in question&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google&#39;s reputation for killing products causes a negative feedback loop. When&#xA;Google releases a product that relies on market buy-in---say, a watch OS (needs&#xA;app developer buy-in) or a chat app (needs consumer buy-in)---it&#39;s an uphill&#xA;battle to get the market on board, because it knows Google may turn around and&#xA;kill the product anyway. This lack of buy-in seals the product&#39;s fate, and it&#xA;goes to the graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Apple&#39;s reputation for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; killing products causes the market to&#xA;embrace it with open arms, kicking off a positive feedback loop that ensures its&#xA;success. iPad needed developers to design for a different form factor to be&#xA;successful, and they did. Apple Watch needed developers to design watch flows&#xA;for their app to be successful, and they did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are more factors at play than reputation, like developer experience and&#xA;user experience, but the point stands---a reputation for killing products&#xA;contributes to more product deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;specifics&#34;&gt;Specific Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are my notes on moving between the ecosystems at specific touchpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;macos&#34;&gt;ArchLinux → macOS&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a decade,&#xA;so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass migration. I grew up&#xA;gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for development due to a love of the&#xA;POSIX command line and the simplicity of the system. I found macOS to scratch&#xA;the same itches without the days spent customizing and debugging things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use to&#xA;apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and, including taps, a&#xA;breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it) the AUR. It also bundles its&#xA;own service management, e.g.&#xA;&lt;code&gt;brew services start postgresql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between Windows&#xA;security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It&#39;s good enough that it&#xA;stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I&#39;ll have to type my password&#xA;to unlock 1Password here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The app ethos on macOS is that all apps are self-contained &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; files, and&#xA;uninstalling an app is defined as &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;ing that file. It&#39;s spoiled me to&#xA;hesitation when I encounter the rare app that needs an installer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half the apps I use are available on the macOS App Store. For apps it&#xA;manages, it handles updates, payments, and even&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting_app_store_reviews&#34;&gt;prompts for&#xA;review&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;I generally look there first when searching for an app, then Homebrew (if I know&#xA;what I&#39;m looking for), then Google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ipad&#34;&gt;Nexus 7 → iPad&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it should&#xA;give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user to be&#xA;using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the&#xA;tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually worse than using the&#xA;same app on my phone. I expected a more polished but overall similar&#xA;experience from iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some light&#xA;computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the form factor; apps&#xA;use it to display more and differently laid out information. Generally, the&#xA;extra horizontal space is used to persistently display a nav menu or the&#xA;previous screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ imgs&#xA;   &#34;Wikipedia on iPhone vs. iPad.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;iphone&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPhone&#34;&#xA;   &#34;ipad&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPad, using extra space for navigation&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw this as a&#xA;marketing move, but I&#39;ve learned they really did push the needle more in the&#xA;direction of general-purpose computing. The three features that did it for me&#xA;are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multiple windows for one app&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Files app&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better multitasking&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but being able&#xA;to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply feels great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second monitor, and&#xA;the ability to use my Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control the iPad. macOS’s&#xA;Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input device for signing documents&#xA;and marking up images. This is something I did before by manually transferring&#xA;files, but now it’s two clicks with instant sync.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;iphone&#34;&gt;Pixel → iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was initially surprised iPhone and iPad lack feature parity. This first came&#xA;up trying to swipe-type on iPad. Another is iPad can show multiple apps on the&#xA;screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay. I felt&#xA;confused at first, but I see Apple’s angle---none of these quite make sense on&#xA;the other form factor. They’d rather deny you the feature than allow using it to&#xA;be confusing or unintuitive. Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad&#xA;because Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more native apps I use on iOS, the better the UX gets. For example, you&#xA;can use multi-touch to drag-and-drop items between apps. Third-party apps only&#xA;implement this functionality sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ videos&#xA;&#34;Using multi-touch to drag and drop items between apps.&#34;&#xA;&#34;drag-photos&#34;&#xA;&#34;drag-text&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FaceID is about on par with fingerprint unlock on Pixel. They each encounter&#xA;their own situational troubles, but both are great overall and I&#39;m no more or&#xA;less happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;fi&#34;&gt;Google Fi&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier. We&#xA;decided to stay with it because they&#39;d recently started to officially support&#xA;iPhone. However, after about a year we found out that Google Fi had been&#xA;intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages from iPhones, leading a friend&#xA;and I to think we were ghosting each other. Once we learned this, we&#xA;immediately switched.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I can&#39;t&#xA;see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and long-term bug that&#xA;was never even communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;notifications&#34;&gt;Notifications&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference&#xA;makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call them a sidegrade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on&#xA;your phone then read that email on any platform, the notification goes away.&#xA;Otherwise, the notification will be there even days later. In this way,&#xA;Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the notification is&#xA;(usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the phone is unlocked the&#xA;notification moves to a secondary location “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen.&#xA;I do inbox zero, so this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications&#xA;by committing the cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers in the&#xA;corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android notifications&#xA;are, so can be used as a todo list. I’ve found these a decent enough&#xA;substitute, although I still prefer Android’s notifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;imessage&#34;&gt;iMessage&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about&#xA;“solving” mobile chat---it’s been solved for them for years. iMessage is the&#xA;gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the guilty urge to nudge friends&#xA;towards iPhone so I can use it with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In classic Apple fashion iMessages aren’t between Apple accounts, but devices.&#xA;I recently changed my email address but I need to keep my old one in my Apple&#xA;account indefinitely so my friends’ threads with me won’t retroactively split&#xA;into two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iMessage include automatically entering SMS 2FA codes on&#xA;any device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;Signing into a website on macOS using the SMS 2FA code from iPhone.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;2fa&#34;&#xA;   &#34;Screenshot of a 2FA prompt suggesting an auto-fill from iMessage&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;watch&#34;&gt;Moto 360 &amp;amp;rarr; Apple Watch&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My relationship with the Moto 360 was on and off. To me it served two&#xA;functions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let me check the time without taking out my phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let me check a notification without taking out my phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These were helpful functions, but the work of managing an extra battery to&#xA;charge and an extra device to put on and take off made me fluctuate every six&#xA;months or so between wearing it every day and not wearing it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Watch adds enough bullet points that I&#39;ve had no such fluctuations---I&#xA;wear it daily:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unlock macOS/iOS when nearby, in lieu of entering a password/passcode&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vibrate in patterns for Apple Maps navigation directions (e.g. one pattern&#xA;for upcoming left, another for upcoming right)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pay using Apple Pay by tapping&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shazam a song without taking out your phone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Show popped reminders or upcoming calendar events on the watch face&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Control Keynote presentations (e.g. tap for next slide)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;View your phone&#39;s camera viewfinder live and tap to snap (e.g. for group&#xA;photos)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Control media playback&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#34;Walkie-talkie&#34; with a close friend&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above, the third-party app ecosystem plays ball with Apple&#xA;Watch a lot more than the Android app ecosystem does with Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;appletv&#34;&gt;Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have HomePods and my spouse forbids me to get any after filling our&#xA;home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey Google,&#xA;play &lt;code&gt;$SHOW&lt;/code&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;remote&#34;&gt;The Remote&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that it&#39;s&#xA;pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use;&#xA;I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it has a good build quality and feels good in the hand. But it’s a&#xA;remote and can be lost. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that attaches to the&#xA;coffee table. I miss the remote-free life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is selected on&#xA;the Apple TV, a notification shows on my iOS devices allowing me to use them&#xA;as a keyboard. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for&#xA;invoking 1Password to fill logins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;home&#34;&gt;Google Home → Apple Home&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent building up&#xA;our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a Raspberry Pi made it all&#xA;work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV showing our Nest doorbell camera&#xA;picture-in-picture when the doorbell rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a&#xA;Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home Hub.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list that&#xA;feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT gateway,&#xA;having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center pull-down menus, and&#xA;hooking up more devices through automation with Shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;airpods&#34;&gt;Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true.&#xA;Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my&#xA;ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between devices based&#xA;on attention, and Siri integration slightly worse than Pixel Buds&#39;s Google&#xA;Assistant imtegration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mail&#34;&gt;Gmail → iCloud Mail&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I control&#xA;anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;migrating&#34;&gt;Migrating&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the experience&#xA;was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired result. After&#xA;starting from scratch several times and hitting new issues every time, I’ve&#xA;chosen to live the life of searching in two places when I need something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To migrate, I coopted ben@twos.dev from Google Workspace which I had only used&#xA;for a little consulting. This caused a few minor issues and UX hiccups because&#xA;Workspace Gmail behaved as if it were still my provider, but DNS wasn&#39;t&#xA;delivering it anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted my main Google account to match my main email address, so I tried to&#xA;use this Google Workspace account as my new primary Google account. But many&#xA;Google features don&#39;t support Workspace accounts, like Google One, family&#xA;sharing, some security features, and (for better and worse) some types of data&#xA;harvesting and therefore ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I tried sticking with my classic Google account and accepting that its&#xA;email would always be different from my preferred email. I finally snagged my&#xA;leg on Google Groups, as Groups does not recognize alternative email addresses&#xA;on Google accounts; I was forced to be presented as my old email address.&#xA;(Though I did not test if posting via email from ben@twos.dev worked.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve now landed on creating a new personal Google account with ben@twos.dev as&#xA;its primary email address. I needed to delete the twos.dev Google Workspace&#xA;organization to do this, as it had claim to ben@twos.dev already. Signing up&#xA;to Google without an @gmail.com address is a somewhat hidden option when&#xA;signing up for Google. Beware that you can later &#34;upgrade&#34; to an @gmail.com&#xA;account, but you can never change back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;daily&#34;&gt;Daily Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve installed&#xA;Thunderbird to get by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and has a&#xA;solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail&#39;s junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk folder,&#xA;even after months of correcting it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud Drive links&#xA;instead, but I&#39;ve had recipients experience trouble downloading them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail&#39;s search is bad. On macOS, it searches only the mailbox being viewed&#xA;(e.g. Inbox) by default. Because I do inbox zero, this is never what I want to&#xA;search. (iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by default.) When you are&#xA;done searching and click Inbox to &#34;return home&#34; the search field doesn&#39;t&#xA;clear, leading you to believe your Inbox is empty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring that, Gmail still wins search by an order of magnitude. For example,&#xA;Gmail searches the contents of PDFs attached to emails; I’ve found this&#xA;invaluable finding old leases and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail is okay at displaying emails as conversations. Once in a while, it omits&#xA;something it shouldn’t. When I click Send while replying to a thread it&#xA;doesn&#39;t immediately append my message, causing me to believe something went&#xA;wrong. I experience long, uncollapsible nested quotes in some emails, where&#xA;Gmail was always good at collapsing them automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service has a&#xA;separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have disparate&#xA;feature sets and don&#39;t synchronize. iOS Mail does not support filters. I’ve&#xA;opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because the iCloud filters can only&#xA;check one condition per filter, and I just have my iMac stay awake 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to archive.&#xA;Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for any app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;Any app&#39;s menu actions (e.g. File &amp;amp;rarr; Save) can be [re]bound.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;rebind&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of macOS&#39;s Settings.app rebinding a key for Mail.app&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want a Mail-like experience with Gmail as a backend, instead of using&#xA;SMTP I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://mimestream.com&#34;&gt;Mimestream&lt;/a&gt;; it is written by a former&#xA;Apple engineer on Mail to have a similar UX but using proper Gmail APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in Spotlight&#xA;and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;calendar&#34;&gt;Google Calendar → Apple Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may be the first service I switch back to Google. Google Calendar is so&#xA;ubiquitous that I&#39;ve forgotten how limited and finicky calendar protocols are&#xA;at their core. So many things just stop working when you leave Google&#xA;Calendar, all the way down to RSVPs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t recommend using the Week view in Calendar. Like Google Calendar, Apple&#xA;Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to represent the current time of day; but&#xA;this bar extends 100% of the width of the week, and does not do a good job&#xA;showing you which day today is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it is?&#34;&#xA;   &#34;calendar&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of Calendar.app on macOS showing a week with a red line across it.&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing panic&#xA;about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar only shows&#xA;when viewing today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say they&#xA;appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a calendar invitation&#xA;there are two attachments, &lt;code&gt;invite.ics&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mime-attachment.ics&lt;/code&gt;. Each will pop&#xA;up a Calendar float to add the event; I’ve learned to use &lt;code&gt;mime-attachment.ics&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;because it seems to open a two-way connection with the sender’s event, where&#xA;&lt;code&gt;invite.ics&lt;/code&gt; seems to be a local copy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video&#xA;  &#34;Opening a Google Calendar invitation from within the Apple ecosystem.&#34;&#xA;  &#34;mail&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google Calendar is the stickiest part of the Google ecosystem due to the&#xA;features they’ve built on top of vanilla calendaring and their ubiquity.&#xA;Interactions with Google Calendar users, which in my experience is everyone,&#xA;always leave me with a feeling of unease: “did they get this RSVP?” or “did&#xA;their event update with the new time?”. For some use cases, Calendar will RSVP&#xA;by sending an email from your account with a plaintext description of your&#xA;response. I haven’t discovered yet if these are seen by human eyes or&#xA;interpreted automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed to have&#xA;a refresh in a decade. Calendar can automatically generate “travel to” and&#xA;“travel from” events based on the travel time between locations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps and Siri suggestions&#xA;for navigation destinations and video call links.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;maps&#34;&gt;Google Maps → Apple Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly so. But&#xA;that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it’s only gotten good, not great. There are UX benefits over&#xA;Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past this light, then at the next&#xA;one, turn &lt;code&gt;$DIRECTION&lt;/code&gt;”, but about 5% of my trips to new places end me at the&#xA;right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been routed to the delivery&#xA;entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an airport, and the wrong parking&#xA;lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) of a large shopping center.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m continuing to give it chances because I know more data helps, but for&#xA;tight schedules I go back to Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos, menus,&#xA;ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here; their purchase&#xA;of Yelp means they inherit photos &amp;amp; reviews, but even that can&#39;t beat the&#xA;sheer volume Google Maps. I&#39;ve only seen one or two restaurants with ordering&#xA;functionality enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and Calendar,&#xA;Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other sources, and Apple&#xA;Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming turns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;findmy&#34;&gt;Location Sharing &amp;amp;rarr; Find My&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends and&#xA;family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple offering (a&#xA;separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one would be happy with&#xA;the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must launch&#xA;with intention, but it&#39;s a wash for me---I&#39;ve had serendipitous encounters&#xA;enabled by seeing a friend is close by in Google Maps accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AirTags and device tracking are the big Apple killer feature here, which work&#xA;as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one in my bag just to&#xA;have peace of mind. The app sends a notification when I leave &lt;code&gt;$DEVICE&lt;/code&gt; at&#xA;&lt;code&gt;$LOCATION&lt;/code&gt;, with easy controls to disable future notifications for any such&#xA;combination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Google Photos &amp;amp;rarr; Apple Photos&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly, these two products are equivalent. Apple Photos has more powerful&#xA;editing tools but Google Photos has more powerful search. Both have similar&#xA;tooling around memories, viewing photos on maps or by year, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classically, Google has a better web experience and Apple has a better native&#xA;experience, meaning sharing photos with others is better if and only if you&#39;re&#xA;sharing with other iOS users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The migration was simple, but long. Google Takeout produced hundreds of&#xA;gigabytes of exports, which I downloaded onto a Mac and then imported with&#xA;Photos.app. Due to Apple&#39;s offline-first approach synchronization took place&#xA;in the background at reduced speeds. This meant it tried to take place while the&#xA;laptop was closed and charging (even if Photos.app wasn&#39;t open). This was&#xA;jarring at first when trying to babysit the process, as by design it stops&#xA;performing well when you start using the machine. When I learned to let go, it&#xA;showed its colors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects include unified conversations: when you share content from&#xA;Google Photos with someone, you and they can comment on photos and albums; when&#xA;you share content from Apple Photos using Messages, the photos appear inline in&#xA;Messages. If you want to &#34;comment&#34; on one, you simply Reply to that message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;safari&#34;&gt;Chrome → Safari&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from&#xA;bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the Chrome&#xA;chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone applications even&#xA;when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go backward or forward slides&#xA;the page on/off screen allowing you to peek without navigating, but it&#xA;backfires and feels artificial for low-travel anchor links and some&#xA;single-page app transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the&#xA;navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can&#39;t&#xA;identify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it works it&#39;s beautiful and useful, but when it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s jarring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video &#34;Navigating through history in Safari with swipe gestures.&#34; &#34;back&#34;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced some&#xA;webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others (local only); Meet also supports&#xA;more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one tab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff (move a browsing session between&#xA;devices smoothly) and the downright bonkers power efficiency of Safari on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;keychain&#34;&gt;iCloud Keychain&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While moving to Safari, I replaced 1Password with iCloud Keychain. It serves&#xA;basic needs, but that’s it. It can store a username, a password, a 2FA code,&#xA;and a domain name for each entry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It cannot store two domains for one entry, e.g. gmail.com and google.com. It&#xA;cannot store arbitrary notes on an entry, e.g. the PIN that T-Mobile customer&#xA;service agents ask for. It cannot name an entry, e.g. Washington Corporations&#xA;and Charities System instead of ccfs.sos.wa.gov. It cannot store non-login&#xA;entries like documents, ID numbers, or insurance information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the 2FA field involves manual effort. Scanning rarely works, so I enter&#xA;the 2FA secret by copying and pasting the code. Some sites provide a raw code,&#xA;while others wrap the code in a URL that contains other metadata. 1Password&#xA;accepts either, but iCloud Keychain assumes you hand it a code; if you hand it&#xA;a URL it will silently accept it but produce incorrect codes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I moved back to 1Password.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include faster and more fluid autofill&#xA;support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;numbers&#34;&gt;Google Sheets → Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a casual spreadsheets user, Sheets and Numbers are nearly identical.&#xA;Numbers has nicer UX when editing formulae that visualizes cell(s) being&#xA;referenced. It tries to humanize references, e.g. “Ben age” for a cell in a&#xA;row with header “Ben” and a column with header “Age”, instead of A:123. This&#xA;is nice until headers get long and multiworded. Overall it’s a wash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;pages&#34;&gt;Google Docs → Pages&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(To be filled in; I have not had much Pages experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Keep → Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking---get out of my way and let me&#xA;write, then let me deal with it later. Keep supplies that. Its layout is hard to&#xA;browse, but it makes up for it with great search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on&#xA;shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform, with roughly the same&#xA;text formatting options as Markdown (unfortunately without the markup).&#xA;Instead of adding several notes to a category or color in Keep, I append to an&#xA;existing note that contains several thoughts. This keeps the number of notes&#xA;down, which makes categorization more reasonable, which improves browsing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s a wash between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts and cross-app drag-and-drop. I&#xA;use a shortcut to create a new note titled and sorted correctly before&#xA;starting a Chinese lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;reminders&#34;&gt;Tasks → Reminders&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS. Reminders can be scheduled&#xA;to “pop” at a date, a date and time, a location, and/or when messaging&#xA;&lt;code&gt;$PERSON&lt;/code&gt;. Reminders can belong to lists (e.g. work vs. personal), lists can be&#xA;shared (e.g. family chores), and reminders within shared lists can be assigned&#xA;to people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reminders have a name, description, URL field, and priority (higher priority&#xA;reminders are sorted higher and given special UI treatment). Reminders can&#xA;have images attached to them, and any number of subtasks. They can be tagged&#xA;and flagged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful app, but everything is presented simply. There is a native&#xA;macOS app that synchronizes, so I get proper notifications on most of my&#xA;devices. In app, I use the “Today” view which shows reminders ready to be&#xA;addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one use case, my spouse and I share a family reminders list. On that list,&#xA;a reminder to take out the trash pops every trash day when I arrive home. It’s&#xA;assigned to me, but if she happens to do it before I get home she can check it&#xA;off; it then won&#39;t pop for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share sheet in&#xA;native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in the URL field)&#xA;and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder (if any) on my Apple&#xA;Watch homescreen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;siri&#34;&gt;Google Assistant → Siri&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can&#39;t answer questions&#xA;like &#34;What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?&#34; or &#34;Who played Alan in&#xA;Tron Legacy?&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Siri include surface-level interaction with native apps:&#xA;setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home devices, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;shortcuts&#34;&gt;Google Assistant Routines → Shortcuts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most&#xA;power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had&#xA;around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it to shell&#xA;scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ img&#xA;   &#34;I use Shortcuts.app to block times on my work calendar based on personal events.&#34;&#xA;   &#34;shortcuts&#34;&#xA;   &#34;A screenshot of a shortcut on iOS&#34;&#xA;}}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one example, I like to write in an app called iA Writer. I use Shortcuts to&#xA;automatically commit and push my writing to this website daily. Because iA&#xA;Writer stores files in iCloud, and another app called Working Copy can&#xA;interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Pull from &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; remote&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(iOS) Get contents of folder &lt;code&gt;iCloud/iA Writer/Published&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Write contents of folder to &lt;code&gt;./src&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Stage &lt;code&gt;./src&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Commit &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; with message “Automatic commit by iA Writer&#xA;sync job”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Working Copy) Push &lt;code&gt;twos.dev&lt;/code&gt; to remote&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could&#xA;do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say that my phone is&#xA;a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;drive&#34;&gt;Google Drive &amp;amp;rarr; iCloud Drive&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception. Use it&#xA;if you&#39;re in the Apple ecosystem, and don&#39;t if you&#39;re not. The biggest downside&#xA;I&#39;ve witnessed is that iCloud Drive does not have an API. This is not a problem&#xA;when running software on a persistent macOS or Windows machine, but for Linux or&#xA;for ephemeral machines (e.g. CI) the only option is an unofficial&#xA;reverse-engineered solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow between&#xA;your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for first-party and&#xA;some third-party apps to use it as a default data store anyway (e.g. Pages&#xA;saves documents there, Numbers saves spreadsheets there).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;macOS also pulls a trick where it allows you to queue up actions on iCloud&#xA;Drive files that haven&#39;t yet fully synced to your machine yet. For example, if&#xA;you download an image to iCloud Drive on your iPhone, it will show up&#xA;~immediately on macOS Finder, then begin syncing. If you try to open the file&#xA;on macOS before it finishes, the open action will queue until the sync&#xA;finishes, then execute. This behavior is nice most of the time (compared to&#xA;the industry standard of trying to open a broken file), but when you first&#xA;encounter it with a large file like a video it&#39;s easy to perceive it as&#xA;slowness or stalling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;YouTube Music → Apple Music&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:&#xA;services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified a lot&#xA;of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator workflow that&#xA;would move the cursor to my existing library, select and copy a title, then&#xA;move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and add the top result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with the&#xA;iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app. Navigation is&#xA;slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact that it takes too many&#xA;transitions to get where you’re going. For details on its UX failings, see (Jake&#xA;from Cinnamon&#39;s&#xA;post)[&lt;a href=&#34;https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem&#34;&gt;https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I miss Google Play Music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration and better&#xA;Siri support for when I’m driving and want to play something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;pay&#34;&gt;Google Pay → Apple Pay&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me embarrassed to use&#xA;it. It was hard to find &#34;the spot&#34; on credit card machines to tap. Apple Pay&#xA;feels more spatially generous; once I start hunting for the spot, it&#39;s already&#xA;been found. It could be because the iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of&#xA;the device while Pixels have them in the middle, or maybe the world has just&#xA;gotten better at this since then. I&#39;m now using Apple Pay every chance I get.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The apparent meta for credit card companies in the US is to give customers&#xA;either 1.5% cash back on everything, or 1% back on everything and 2-5% back on&#xA;specific categories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple Card gives 2% back on everything purchased through Apple Pay and 1%&#xA;on everything else, which is the best deal I&#39;ve seen. (There are also some&#xA;merchants that do 3%, but I&#39;m not about tracking and optimizing that.) Of the&#xA;purchases I make in Seattle, about 80% of shops and restaurants who do&#xA;pay-at-counter support Apple Pay, and about 20% of table-service restaurants&#xA;do. For online orders, roughly half of the non-Amazon orders I place support&#xA;it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first credit&#xA;card experience that feels like it was made this century. The app is&#xA;beautiful, snappy, and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{{ video &#34;Drilling into Apple Card transactions using Wallet.&#34; &#34;card&#34; }}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a living document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the sum of&#xA;its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned is that it’s&#xA;the long tail of ecosystem benefits that makes up most of that excess. Not the&#xA;two or three things per product I’ve mentioned above, but the dozens that&#xA;happen without me noticing that add up to make a more enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are functional&#xA;benefits to working in a clean space---it’s easier to find things, spilling a&#xA;liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less dust---but the bulk of the&#xA;benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways the space feels better and motivates&#xA;more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of 2022 May, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would not count&#xA;it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell and I&#39;ll continue&#xA;to document my journey here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

</body></html><h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>My life is in Google more than anyone I know. The usual suspects sure---Gmail,
Photos, Chrome, etc.---but also the ones people stay away from---Tasks, Keep,
YouTube Music, Fit, Pay, Play Books, Play Movies &amp; TV, Podcasts, etc. We
have more Google Homes than rooms. I was a beta user for the first Chromebook,
the Cr-48. I have more scar tissue than most from services being sent to the
“Google graveyard”. And for a few years, I overlaid my Facebook profile picture
with a Google+ logo and the text “I’ve moved”. Of course, it's no surprise I’ve
been an Android user for 12 years, 10 of them on Nexus and Pixel devices.</p>

<p>But once in a while I like to challenge my beliefs by changing seats. This is
how I understand why---or whether---I prefer what I chose. For Android, that
means trialing an iPhone. <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/880455300444176384?s=21&amp;t=R2cM8pplLpZNEq6ju3Weaw">I did
this</a>
five years ago for a few months (thanks <a href="https://bensw.com">bensw</a>), but
afterwards I thought "It's actually not that different, it's just that the
Google apps don't feel native, so I’ll stick with Android".</p>

<p>Since then, I've realized it’s hard to know the Apple value proposition
without being immersed in the Apple ecosystem. For the same reason Google apps
don’t shine on iOS, iOS doesn't shine if you only use Google apps.</p>

<p>So after a buggy summer with my Pixel 3a, I decided to give Apple an honest,
holistic, multi-year shot. Its walled garden may not let me out, but better to
trap myself on one side and know both, than trap myself on the other and know
one. These are my notes on hopping the fence.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Broad Themes</h2>

<p>Before I dump my notes about specific transition experiences, I'll summarize
the themes I've witnessed during them.</p>

<h3 id="safety">Safety vs. Freedom</h3>

<p>In 2020 I tried to release a Flutter app on iOS. I'd long ago published its
Android build, but the iOS approval process was yielding denial after denial.
I was frustrated, but I was also a new iOS user, and I could see with fresh
eyes the effects of the strictness.</p>

<p>Compared with Android, iOS apps feel like part of the operating system. They
don't feel like they were written by others, and that makes me feel safe. My
data feels like part of my device, not part of Google. And I trust my device
to manage my payment, location, etc. data, because it is mine. I own it.</p>

<p>That feeling is not strong enough that people will voice it, or fight for it.
But it's a good feeling. And it only comes with control---control by a
representative I trust, over parties I don't. I don't know app developers,
especially small ones. But I know Apple. Through them I can trust app
developers, but only because Apple so heavily controls what they can publish.
They can't send me to their sketchy site or use dark patterns to trick me into
paying them.</p>

<p>Some would say more choice is always better; that if I don't feel safe, I have
the choice not to do the sketchy thing. I disagree. I have "the choice" to do
a food safety inspection of every restaurant I visit, but I do not want to and
I wouldn't know what I'm looking for, so I trust my local health department.</p>

<p>For example, all purchases that enable new app functionality must go through
the Apple in-app purchase flow. As a developer, this means Apple takes a cut
of everything. As a user, this means one central place where I can manage
(read: cancel) subscriptions---no digging through menus or talking to customer
service agents.</p>

<p>{{ imgs
   "The App Store's subscriptions management menus."
   "subscriptions"
   "Screenshot of iOS App Store showing multiple active subscriptions"
   "subscription"
   "iOS App Store showing options to change or cancel a subscription"
}}</p>

<p>Another example: If your app allows signing in with any third party auth
providers, Apple must be one of them. As a developer, this means building
another sign-in flow and database table. As a user, this means I get a native,
one-tap, FaceID sign-in.</p>

<p>{{ video "Signing in with Apple." "signin" }}</p>

<p>These examples continue throughout the ecosystem, and the more I see the more
I believe Apple thinks of itself as a government providing "public goods",
whereas Google optimizes for what increases ad clickthrough---data, eyeballs,
and engagement. Of course, this has its problems. Apple is a private company,
not elected officials, so is only as beholden to its end users as it wants to
be. For now, the incentives seem aligned.</p>

<h3 id="offline">Offline-first vs. Online-first Design</h3>

<p>Having multiple macOS and iOS devices made clear the differences in attitude
Google and Apple have toward user data, and by extension user identity. To
Google, a user is a Google account first; a device is just a window into that
account. The device may have some caching and synchronization to remain useful
offline, but ultimately Google's servers are the source of truth.</p>

<p>To Apple, a user is a device first. iCloud exists to synchronize data between
multiple devices, but it's just that---synchronization. Apps usually wait until
the device is plugged in to bother syncing, and you can even sync with a cable
(or not at all) instead of iCloud.</p>

<p>Here are some ways these differences are expressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google wants a blurry line between web and native experiences; its official
apps are going the way of PWAs and similar tech that can be deployed to web
and app ~identically. In contrast Apple puts every major UX flow in a native
app, from email and calendar to bug reporting and account management. Even
uploading apps to the App Store for publishing---a fundamentally online
experience--is a native app.</li>
<li>Google Docs documents are rows in a database, where Apple Pages documents
are files on a filesystem; sharing and synchronization are handled by iCloud
which is more akin to Dropbox in this mode. It does support 100 simultaneous
writers, but I'm not sure how.</li>
<li>When you message someone with iMessage you are messaging a device (a phone
number or email), not an Apple account---even if the bubble is blue. You may
be unknowingly using a combination of phone and email for one contact, because
iMessage silently interleaves them if they're owned by the same Apple account.
If that person later removes one from their Apple account, your iMessage
thread with them retroactively splits.</li>
<li>In the Google ecosystem, when you take or make a Fi / Voice call from your
computer, you're going through Google's servers. In the Apple ecosystem,
when you take or make a call from your Mac or iPad, you're connecting
locally to your iPhone to route the call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of this local-first approach is charming compared to a monolithic
always-online Google account, but it’s not for everyone. I regularly
experience synchronization delays and conflicts. Sync settings for a machine
are centralized in iCloud settings where they're often off by default. I still
can't get one of my Safaris to synchronize its bookmarks with the rest.</p>

<h3 id="committment">Committment vs. Experimentation</h3>

<p>Google is infamous for killing products. They release early, often, and in
isolation; see Hangouts and Allo, Meet and Duo, or Reminders and Tasks.
Innovation comes first and stablizing the product offering comes second, when
the product is proven (or not proven) to work.</p>

<p>Apple instead takes the "measure twice, cut once" approach; products are
rarely released and rarely killed. The iPod was around for 21 years,
co-existing with the iPhone for 12 of them. Apple Maps was a notoriously
failed app at launch in 2012 and still suffers from that reputational injury,
however <em>it's still around anyway</em> and has improved drastically (although
whether enough is <a href="#maps">still in question</a>).</p>

<p>Google's reputation for killing products causes a negative feedback loop. When
Google releases a product that relies on market buy-in---say, a watch OS (needs
app developer buy-in) or a chat app (needs consumer buy-in)---it's an uphill
battle to get the market on board, because it knows Google may turn around and
kill the product anyway. This lack of buy-in seals the product's fate, and it
goes to the graveyard.</p>

<p>In contrast, Apple's reputation for <em>not</em> killing products causes the market to
embrace it with open arms, kicking off a positive feedback loop that ensures its
success. iPad needed developers to design for a different form factor to be
successful, and they did. Apple Watch needed developers to design watch flows
for their app to be successful, and they did.</p>

<p>There are more factors at play than reputation, like developer experience and
user experience, but the point stands---a reputation for killing products
contributes to more product deaths.</p>

<h2 id="specifics">Specific Notes</h2>

<p>Below are my notes on moving between the ecosystems at specific touchpoints.</p>

<h3 id="macos">ArchLinux → macOS</h3>

<p>I have used one or another Mac as a development machine for nearly a decade,
so this is the only swap not done as part of my mass migration. I grew up
gaming on Windows and moved to Linux for development due to a love of the
POSIX command line and the simplicity of the system. I found macOS to scratch
the same itches without the days spent customizing and debugging things.</p>

<p>Homebrew is as mature as any package manager, similar in ease-of-use to
apt[-get] but with on average more up-to-date packages and, including taps, a
breadth of packages rivaling even (dare I say it) the AUR. It also bundles its
own service management, e.g.
<code>brew services start postgresql</code>.</p>

<p>TouchID is a good middle ground for administrative access between Windows
security (click yes) and Linux (type your password). It's good enough that it
stops me from using clamshell mode more, knowing I'll have to type my password
to unlock 1Password here and there.</p>

<p>The app ethos on macOS is that all apps are self-contained <code>.app</code> files, and
uninstalling an app is defined as <code>rm</code>ing that file. It's spoiled me to
hesitation when I encounter the rare app that needs an installer.</p>

<p>Roughly half the apps I use are available on the macOS App Store. For apps it
manages, it handles updates, payments, and even
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting_app_store_reviews">prompts for
review</a>.
I generally look there first when searching for an app, then Homebrew (if I know
what I'm looking for), then Google.</p>

<h3 id="ipad">Nexus 7 → iPad</h3>

<p>My minimum goal for a tablet is to replace all at-home phone use; it should
give a strictly upgraded experience. As a habit, I carry it room-to-room.</p>

<p>When I used the Nexus 7 as my home tablet, apps didn’t expect one user to be
using two devices, so desync bugs were frequent. Almost zero apps used the
tablet form factor well or at all, so the UX was usually worse than using the
same app on my phone. I expected a more polished but overall similar
experience from iPad.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s fulfilled the minimum goal and has even replaced some light
computer use. The app ecosystem understands and embraces the form factor; apps
use it to display more and differently laid out information. Generally, the
extra horizontal space is used to persistently display a nav menu or the
previous screen.</p>

<p>{{ imgs
   "Wikipedia on iPhone vs. iPad."
   "iphone"
   "A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPhone"
   "ipad"
   "A screenshot of the Wikipedia app on iPad, using extra space for navigation"
}}</p>

<p>A bit ago, Apple rebranded iOS-on-iPad to iPadOS. At the time I saw this as a
marketing move, but I've learned they really did push the needle more in the
direction of general-purpose computing. The three features that did it for me
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple windows for one app</li>
<li>Files app</li>
<li>Better multitasking</li>
</ul>

<p>Only a handful of apps support multiple windows at this time, but being able
to e.g. view one email in a thread while composing a reply feels great.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iPad are the ability to use it as a second monitor, and
the ability to use my Mac’s mouse and keyboard to control the iPad. macOS’s
Preview app allows iPad to be used as an input device for signing documents
and marking up images. This is something I did before by manually transferring
files, but now it’s two clicks with instant sync.</p>

<h3 id="iphone">Pixel → iPhone</h3>

<p>I was initially surprised iPhone and iPad lack feature parity. This first came
up trying to swipe-type on iPad. Another is iPad can show multiple apps on the
screen at a time, but iPhone cannot. iPad has no Wallet or Apple Pay. I felt
confused at first, but I see Apple’s angle---none of these quite make sense on
the other form factor. They’d rather deny you the feature than allow using it to
be confusing or unintuitive. Infamously, there is no calculator app for iPad
because Apple hasn’t found the time to adapt the iPhone calculator design.</p>

<p>The more native apps I use on iOS, the better the UX gets. For example, you
can use multi-touch to drag-and-drop items between apps. Third-party apps only
implement this functionality sometimes.</p>

<p>{{ videos
"Using multi-touch to drag and drop items between apps."
"drag-photos"
"drag-text"
}}</p>

<p>FaceID is about on par with fingerprint unlock on Pixel. They each encounter
their own situational troubles, but both are great overall and I'm no more or
less happy.</p>

<h4 id="fi">Google Fi</h4>

<p>When I switched to iPhone, we had been using Google Fi as our carrier. We
decided to stay with it because they'd recently started to officially support
iPhone. However, after about a year we found out that Google Fi had been
intermittently dropping outgoing SMS messages from iPhones, leading a friend
and I to think we were ghosting each other. Once we learned this, we
immediately switched.</p>

<p>Even if this whole Apple experiment fails and I go back to Android, I can't
see myself trusting Fi again after such an impactful and long-term bug that
was never even communicated.</p>

<h4 id="notifications">Notifications</h4>

<p>Notifications on iOS behave differently than on Android, and that difference
makes them feel worse at first. After some time I’d call them a sidegrade.</p>

<p>Android notifications are stateful. If you receive a Gmail notification on
your phone then read that email on any platform, the notification goes away.
Otherwise, the notification will be there even days later. In this way,
Android notifications can be used as a todo list of sorts.</p>

<p>iOS notifications are a feed. In the same scenario on iOS, the notification is
(usually) never revoked remotely. Instead, when the phone is unlocked the
notification moves to a secondary location “below” (via swipe) the lockscreen.
I do inbox zero, so this is strictly worse. I forget to address notifications
by committing the cardinal sin of unlocking my phone.</p>

<p>However, iOS mostly fills the gap with badges. Badges are red numbers in the
corners of app icons that are stateful in the same way Android notifications
are, so can be used as a todo list. I’ve found these a decent enough
substitute, although I still prefer Android’s notifications.</p>

<h4 id="imessage">iMessage</h4>

<p>I finally know why none of my iPhone friends were as excited as me about
“solving” mobile chat---it’s been solved for them for years. iMessage is the
gold standard of chat apps. I’m even feeling the guilty urge to nudge friends
towards iPhone so I can use it with them.</p>

<p>In classic Apple fashion iMessages aren’t between Apple accounts, but devices.
I recently changed my email address but I need to keep my old one in my Apple
account indefinitely so my friends’ threads with me won’t retroactively split
into two.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iMessage include automatically entering SMS 2FA codes on
any device.</p>

<p>{{ img
   "Signing into a website on macOS using the SMS 2FA code from iPhone."
   "2fa"
   "Screenshot of a 2FA prompt suggesting an auto-fill from iMessage"
}}</p>

<h4 id="watch">Moto 360 &amp;rarr; Apple Watch</h4>

<p>My relationship with the Moto 360 was on and off. To me it served two
functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let me check the time without taking out my phone</li>
<li>Let me check a notification without taking out my phone</li>
</ul>

<p>These were helpful functions, but the work of managing an extra battery to
charge and an extra device to put on and take off made me fluctuate every six
months or so between wearing it every day and not wearing it at all.</p>

<p>Apple Watch adds enough bullet points that I've had no such fluctuations---I
wear it daily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlock macOS/iOS when nearby, in lieu of entering a password/passcode</li>
<li>Vibrate in patterns for Apple Maps navigation directions (e.g. one pattern
for upcoming left, another for upcoming right)</li>
<li>Pay using Apple Pay by tapping</li>
<li>Shazam a song without taking out your phone</li>
<li>Show popped reminders or upcoming calendar events on the watch face</li>
<li>Control Keynote presentations (e.g. tap for next slide)</li>
<li>View your phone's camera viewfinder live and tap to snap (e.g. for group
photos)</li>
<li>Control media playback</li>
<li>"Walkie-talkie" with a close friend</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the above, the third-party app ecosystem plays ball with Apple
Watch a lot more than the Android app ecosystem does with Wear OS.</p>

<h3 id="appletv">Chromecast/Google TV → Apple TV</h3>

<p>We don’t have HomePods and my spouse forbids me to get any after filling our
home with Google Home Minis, so we’ve had to migrate away from “hey Google,
play <code>$SHOW</code>”.</p>

<h4 id="remote">The Remote</h4>

<p>Apple TV can initiate play from a phone like Chromecast, but beyond that it's
pretty remote-centric. The touchpad on the remote is awkward and hard to use;
I brush it when trying to click it, causing me to click on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Otherwise it has a good build quality and feels good in the hand. But it’s a
remote and can be lost. We’ve 3D printed a holder for it that attaches to the
coffee table. I miss the remote-free life.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple TV include typing: when a text input is selected on
the Apple TV, a notification shows on my iOS devices allowing me to use them
as a keyboard. Password manager support works as normal; this is helpful for
invoking 1Password to fill logins.</p>

<h3 id="home">Google Home → Apple Home</h3>

<p>My biggest fear with this change was losing the decade I’ve spent building up
our Google Nest devices, but running Homemanager on a Raspberry Pi made it all
work seamlessly, even down to Apple TV showing our Nest doorbell camera
picture-in-picture when the doorbell rings. (If you’re not keen to set up a
Raspberry Pi, try Starling Home Hub.)</p>

<p>The Apple Home UX is miles better than Google Home’s long device list that
feels like a web page. This was a strict upgrade. Automation is a breeze.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Home include using Apple TV as your IoT gateway,
having home controls in the iOS and macOS control center pull-down menus, and
hooking up more devices through automation with Shortcuts.</p>

<h3 id="airpods">Pixel Buds → AirPods Pro</h3>

<p>Everything you’ve heard about the AirPods Pro noise cancellation is true.
Transparency mode is so good that more than once I’ve forgotten they’re in my
ears. They’ve more than replaced my Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of AirPods include automatic switching between devices based
on attention, and Siri integration slightly worse than Pixel Buds's Google
Assistant imtegration.</p>

<h3 id="mail">Gmail → iCloud Mail</h3>

<p>The big one. I’ve been wanting to switch my email to a domain I control
anyway, and iCloud+ supports that.</p>

<h4 id="migrating">Migrating</h4>

<p>I don’t recommend importing Gmail archives into iCloud Mail; the experience
was fraught with landmines and didn’t achieve the desired result. After
starting from scratch several times and hitting new issues every time, I’ve
chosen to live the life of searching in two places when I need something.</p>

<p>To migrate, I coopted ben@twos.dev from Google Workspace which I had only used
for a little consulting. This caused a few minor issues and UX hiccups because
Workspace Gmail behaved as if it were still my provider, but DNS wasn't
delivering it anything.</p>

<p>I wanted my main Google account to match my main email address, so I tried to
use this Google Workspace account as my new primary Google account. But many
Google features don't support Workspace accounts, like Google One, family
sharing, some security features, and (for better and worse) some types of data
harvesting and therefore ad targeting.</p>

<p>So, I tried sticking with my classic Google account and accepting that its
email would always be different from my preferred email. I finally snagged my
leg on Google Groups, as Groups does not recognize alternative email addresses
on Google accounts; I was forced to be presented as my old email address.
(Though I did not test if posting via email from ben@twos.dev worked.)</p>

<p>I've now landed on creating a new personal Google account with ben@twos.dev as
its primary email address. I needed to delete the twos.dev Google Workspace
organization to do this, as it had claim to ben@twos.dev already. Signing up
to Google without an @gmail.com address is a somewhat hidden option when
signing up for Google. Beware that you can later "upgrade" to an @gmail.com
account, but you can never change back.</p>

<h4 id="daily">Daily Use</h4>

<p>The iCloud web interface is bad. On my Windows gaming computer I’ve installed
Thunderbird to get by.</p>

<p>Mail itself integrates very well with the rest of the ecosystem and has a
solid UX at its core, but is plagued paradoxically by usability issues:</p>

<p>Mail's junk filter sorts ~one legitimate email per week into the junk folder,
even after months of correcting it.</p>

<p>When attaching large files Mail allows you to send them as iCloud Drive links
instead, but I've had recipients experience trouble downloading them.</p>

<p>Mail's search is bad. On macOS, it searches only the mailbox being viewed
(e.g. Inbox) by default. Because I do inbox zero, this is never what I want to
search. (iOS and iPadOS correctly search everything by default.) When you are
done searching and click Inbox to "return home" the search field doesn't
clear, leading you to believe your Inbox is empty.</p>

<p>Ignoring that, Gmail still wins search by an order of magnitude. For example,
Gmail searches the contents of PDFs attached to emails; I’ve found this
invaluable finding old leases and whatnot.</p>

<p>Mail is okay at displaying emails as conversations. Once in a while, it omits
something it shouldn’t. When I click Send while replying to a thread it
doesn't immediately append my message, causing me to believe something went
wrong. I experience long, uncollapsible nested quotes in some emails, where
Gmail was always good at collapsing them automatically.</p>

<p>macOS Mail supports filters, but only locally. The iCloud Mail service has a
separate filter system with the same effect, but the two have disparate
feature sets and don't synchronize. iOS Mail does not support filters. I’ve
opted to use Mail’s local-only filters because the iCloud filters can only
check one condition per filter, and I just have my iMac stay awake 24/7.</p>

<p>macOS Mail has horrible keyboard shortcuts by default, e.g. ⌘^A to archive.
Thankfully macOS natively supports rebinding shortcuts for any app.</p>

<p>{{ img

   "rebind"
   "A screenshot of macOS's Settings.app rebinding a key for Mail.app"
}}</p>

<p>If you want a Mail-like experience with Gmail as a backend, instead of using
SMTP I recommend <a href="https://mimestream.com">Mimestream</a>; it is written by a former
Apple engineer on Mail to have a similar UX but using proper Gmail APIs.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Mail include having search results show up in Spotlight
and behaving super well as a multitasking app on iPadOS.</p>

<h3 id="calendar">Google Calendar → Apple Calendar</h3>

<p>This may be the first service I switch back to Google. Google Calendar is so
ubiquitous that I've forgotten how limited and finicky calendar protocols are
at their core. So many things just stop working when you leave Google
Calendar, all the way down to RSVPs.</p>

<p>I don't recommend using the Week view in Calendar. Like Google Calendar, Apple
Calendar uses a horizontal red bar to represent the current time of day; but
this bar extends 100% of the width of the week, and does not do a good job
showing you which day today is.</p>

<p>{{ img
   "Week view in Apple Calendar. At a glance, can you tell what day it is?"
   "calendar"
   "A screenshot of Calendar.app on macOS showing a week with a red line across it."
}}</p>

<p>This has led me to misread the current day multiple times, inducing panic
about being late for meetings. I now use Day view, where the bar only shows
when viewing today.</p>

<p>Mail has no special treatment of calendar invitations, which is to say they
appear as raw attachments. When Google Calendar users send a calendar invitation
there are two attachments, <code>invite.ics</code> and <code>mime-attachment.ics</code>. Each will pop
up a Calendar float to add the event; I’ve learned to use <code>mime-attachment.ics</code>
because it seems to open a two-way connection with the sender’s event, where
<code>invite.ics</code> seems to be a local copy.</p>

<p>{{ video
  "Opening a Google Calendar invitation from within the Apple ecosystem."
  "mail"
}}</p>

<p>Google Calendar is the stickiest part of the Google ecosystem due to the
features they’ve built on top of vanilla calendaring and their ubiquity.
Interactions with Google Calendar users, which in my experience is everyone,
always leave me with a feeling of unease: “did they get this RSVP?” or “did
their event update with the new time?”. For some use cases, Calendar will RSVP
by sending an email from your account with a plaintext description of your
response. I haven’t discovered yet if these are seen by human eyes or
interpreted automatically.</p>

<p>Calendar’s UI is prettier than Google Calendar’s, which hasn’t seemed to have
a refresh in a decade. Calendar can automatically generate “travel to” and
“travel from” events based on the travel time between locations.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Calendar include context-aware Maps and Siri suggestions
for navigation destinations and video call links.</p>

<h3 id="maps">Google Maps → Apple Maps</h3>

<p>Apple Maps gets a lot of flak for its initial release state, rightly so. But
that was years ago, and they’ve kept at it. It’s improved.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s only gotten good, not great. There are UX benefits over
Google Maps, such as the spoken direction “Go past this light, then at the next
one, turn <code>$DIRECTION</code>”, but about 5% of my trips to new places end me at the
right area but wrong specific destination. I’ve been routed to the delivery
entrance for a museum, the back entrance for an airport, and the wrong parking
lot (15 minutes of walking wrong) of a large shopping center.</p>

<p>I’m continuing to give it chances because I know more data helps, but for
tight schedules I go back to Google Maps.</p>

<p>Then there's the other dimension of Google Maps: reviews, photos, menus,
ordering, and reservations. Apple is a generation behind here; their purchase
of Yelp means they inherit photos &amp; reviews, but even that can't beat the
sheer volume Google Maps. I've only seen one or two restaurants with ordering
functionality enabled.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Maps include rich links in iMessage and Calendar,
Siri suggestions for destinations based on those and other sources, and Apple
Watch vibration patterns to indicate upcoming turns.</p>

<h4 id="findmy">Location Sharing &amp;rarr; Find My</h4>

<p>I use persistent location sharing with a small set of close friends and
family. The Google offering (built into Google Maps) and the Apple offering (a
separate Find My app) are similar; anyone happy with one would be happy with
the other.</p>

<p>I can see why Apple decided to contain the feature in an app you must launch
with intention, but it's a wash for me---I've had serendipitous encounters
enabled by seeing a friend is close by in Google Maps accidentally.</p>

<p>AirTags and device tracking are the big Apple killer feature here, which work
as seamlessly as advertised. I threw one in my car and one in my bag just to
have peace of mind. The app sends a notification when I leave <code>$DEVICE</code> at
<code>$LOCATION</code>, with easy controls to disable future notifications for any such
combination.</p>

<h3 id="photos">Google Photos &amp;rarr; Apple Photos</h3>

<p>Mostly, these two products are equivalent. Apple Photos has more powerful
editing tools but Google Photos has more powerful search. Both have similar
tooling around memories, viewing photos on maps or by year, etc.</p>

<p>Classically, Google has a better web experience and Apple has a better native
experience, meaning sharing photos with others is better if and only if you're
sharing with other iOS users.</p>

<p>The migration was simple, but long. Google Takeout produced hundreds of
gigabytes of exports, which I downloaded onto a Mac and then imported with
Photos.app. Due to Apple's offline-first approach synchronization took place
in the background at reduced speeds. This meant it tried to take place while the
laptop was closed and charging (even if Photos.app wasn't open). This was
jarring at first when trying to babysit the process, as by design it stops
performing well when you start using the machine. When I learned to let go, it
showed its colors.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects include unified conversations: when you share content from
Google Photos with someone, you and they can comment on photos and albums; when
you share content from Apple Photos using Messages, the photos appear inline in
Messages. If you want to "comment" on one, you simply Reply to that message.</p>

<h3 id="safari">Chrome → Safari</h3>

<p>This was a far less noticeable change than I expected. Everything from
bookmark sync to my extensions to rendering works the same.</p>

<p>In macOS the Safari chrome fades into the background better than the Chrome
chrome, such that websites feel a bit closer to standalone applications even
when in a tabbed window. The touch gesture to go backward or forward slides
the page on/off screen allowing you to peek without navigating, but it
backfires and feels artificial for low-travel anchor links and some
single-page app transitions. It also sometimes reveals a blank page until the
navigation event triggers (when the gesture ends) for reasons I can't
identify.</p>

<p>When it works it's beautiful and useful, but when it doesn't it's jarring.</p>

<p>{{ video "Navigating through history in Safari with swipe gestures." "back"}}</p>

<p>I tend to switch back to Chrome for Meet meetings, as I’ve experienced some
webcam freezing in Safari of myself or others (local only); Meet also supports
more types of screen sharing in Chrome, like sharing one tab.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Safari include Handoff (move a browsing session between
devices smoothly) and the downright bonkers power efficiency of Safari on macOS.</p>

<h4 id="keychain">iCloud Keychain</h4>

<p>While moving to Safari, I replaced 1Password with iCloud Keychain. It serves
basic needs, but that’s it. It can store a username, a password, a 2FA code,
and a domain name for each entry.</p>

<p>It cannot store two domains for one entry, e.g. gmail.com and google.com. It
cannot store arbitrary notes on an entry, e.g. the PIN that T-Mobile customer
service agents ask for. It cannot name an entry, e.g. Washington Corporations
and Charities System instead of ccfs.sos.wa.gov. It cannot store non-login
entries like documents, ID numbers, or insurance information.</p>

<p>Using the 2FA field involves manual effort. Scanning rarely works, so I enter
the 2FA secret by copying and pasting the code. Some sites provide a raw code,
while others wrap the code in a URL that contains other metadata. 1Password
accepts either, but iCloud Keychain assumes you hand it a code; if you hand it
a URL it will silently accept it but produce incorrect codes.</p>

<p>I moved back to 1Password.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Keychain include faster and more fluid autofill
support in Safari, on both macOS and iOS.</p>

<h3 id="numbers">Google Sheets → Numbers</h3>

<p>As a casual spreadsheets user, Sheets and Numbers are nearly identical.
Numbers has nicer UX when editing formulae that visualizes cell(s) being
referenced. It tries to humanize references, e.g. “Ben age” for a cell in a
row with header “Ben” and a column with header “Age”, instead of A:123. This
is nice until headers get long and multiworded. Overall it’s a wash.</p>

<h3 id="pages">Google Docs → Pages</h3>

<p>(To be filled in; I have not had much Pages experience.)</p>

<h3 id="notes">Keep → Notes</h3>

<p>I value simplicity and elasticity in notetaking---get out of my way and let me
write, then let me deal with it later. Keep supplies that. Its layout is hard to
browse, but it makes up for it with great search.</p>

<p>Notes is simple and elastic in a different way. Where Keep focuses on
shortform sticky-style notes, Notes focuses on longform, with roughly the same
text formatting options as Markdown (unfortunately without the markup).
Instead of adding several notes to a category or color in Keep, I append to an
existing note that contains several thoughts. This keeps the number of notes
down, which makes categorization more reasonable, which improves browsing.</p>

<p>For me, it’s a wash between the two.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Notes include Shortcuts and cross-app drag-and-drop. I
use a shortcut to create a new note titled and sorted correctly before
starting a Chinese lesson.</p>

<h3 id="reminders">Tasks → Reminders</h3>

<p>Reminders is one of the best-designed apps on iOS. Reminders can be scheduled
to “pop” at a date, a date and time, a location, and/or when messaging
<code>$PERSON</code>. Reminders can belong to lists (e.g. work vs. personal), lists can be
shared (e.g. family chores), and reminders within shared lists can be assigned
to people.</p>

<p>Reminders have a name, description, URL field, and priority (higher priority
reminders are sorted higher and given special UI treatment). Reminders can
have images attached to them, and any number of subtasks. They can be tagged
and flagged.</p>

<p>It’s a powerful app, but everything is presented simply. There is a native
macOS app that synchronizes, so I get proper notifications on most of my
devices. In app, I use the “Today” view which shows reminders ready to be
addressed.</p>

<p>As one use case, my spouse and I share a family reminders list. On that list,
a reminder to take out the trash pops every trash day when I arrive home. It’s
assigned to me, but if she happens to do it before I get home she can check it
off; it then won't pop for me.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Reminders include integration with the share sheet in
native apps (e.g. sharing from Safari automatically fills in the URL field)
and the ability to persistently show a popped reminder (if any) on my Apple
Watch homescreen.</p>

<h3 id="siri">Google Assistant → Siri</h3>

<p>Siri is nearly strictly worse than Google Assistant. It can't answer questions
like "What temperature do I need to cook chicken to?" or "Who played Alan in
Tron Legacy?".</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Siri include surface-level interaction with native apps:
setting reminders, playing music, controlling Home devices, etc.</p>

<h3 id="shortcuts">Google Assistant Routines → Shortcuts</h3>

<p>I can’t say enough good things about Shortcuts. It is the most
power-user-friendly thing about iOS and goes against all expectations I had
around Apple and power users. For life automation, I prefer it to shell
scripts.</p>

<p>{{ img
   "I use Shortcuts.app to block times on my work calendar based on personal events."
   "shortcuts"
   "A screenshot of a shortcut on iOS"
}}</p>

<p>As one example, I like to write in an app called iA Writer. I use Shortcuts to
automatically commit and push my writing to this website daily. Because iA
Writer stores files in iCloud, and another app called Working Copy can
interact with Git repositories, Shortcuts lets me glue them together:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Working Copy) Pull from <code>twos.dev</code> remote</li>
<li>(iOS) Get contents of folder <code>iCloud/iA Writer/Published</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Write contents of folder to <code>./src</code> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Stage <code>./src</code> in <code>twos.dev</code></li>
<li>(Working Copy) Commit <code>twos.dev</code> with message “Automatic commit by iA Writer
sync job”</li>
<li>(Working Copy) Push <code>twos.dev</code> to remote</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m a software engineer and am comfortable coding, but the fact that I could
do all this without any was impressive. It’s also fun to say that my phone is
a vital part of my CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="drive">Google Drive &amp;rarr; iCloud Drive</h3>

<p>Most Dropbox-esque apps are the same and iCloud Drive is no exception. Use it
if you're in the Apple ecosystem, and don't if you're not. The biggest downside
I've witnessed is that iCloud Drive does not have an API. This is not a problem
when running software on a persistent macOS or Windows machine, but for Linux or
for ephemeral machines (e.g. CI) the only option is an unofficial
reverse-engineered solution.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of iCloud Drive include a more native sharing flow between
your drive and apps (in both directions) and a tendancy for first-party and
some third-party apps to use it as a default data store anyway (e.g. Pages
saves documents there, Numbers saves spreadsheets there).</p>

<p>macOS also pulls a trick where it allows you to queue up actions on iCloud
Drive files that haven't yet fully synced to your machine yet. For example, if
you download an image to iCloud Drive on your iPhone, it will show up
~immediately on macOS Finder, then begin syncing. If you try to open the file
on macOS before it finishes, the open action will queue until the sync
finishes, then execute. This behavior is nice most of the time (compared to
the industry standard of trying to open a broken file), but when you first
encounter it with a large file like a video it's easy to perceive it as
slowness or stalling.</p>

<h3 id="music">YouTube Music → Apple Music</h3>

<p>Apple Music is a great example of the big place Apple still struggles:
services.</p>

<p>Importing my music was a headache and missed or incorrectly identified a lot
of songs. The most reliable method I had involved an Automator workflow that
would move the cursor to my existing library, select and copy a title, then
move it to Apple Music’s search field, paste, and add the top result.</p>

<p>The UI of Apple Music for macOS is a let-down and is more on par with the
iCloud Mail web interface than with any other native Apple app. Navigation is
slow and unresponsive, which is compounded by the fact that it takes too many
transitions to get where you’re going. For details on its UX failings, see (Jake
from Cinnamon's
post)[<a href="https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem">https://cinnamon.agency/blog/post/apple_musics_ux_problem</a>].</p>

<p>I miss Google Play Music.</p>

<p>Ecosystem effects of Apple Music include tighter Shazam integration and better
Siri support for when I’m driving and want to play something.</p>

<h3 id="pay">Google Pay → Apple Pay</h3>

<p>I always felt that Google Pay was finicky, and that made me embarrassed to use
it. It was hard to find "the spot" on credit card machines to tap. Apple Pay
feels more spatially generous; once I start hunting for the spot, it's already
been found. It could be because the iPhone NFC chip is located at the top of
the device while Pixels have them in the middle, or maybe the world has just
gotten better at this since then. I'm now using Apple Pay every chance I get.</p>

<p>The apparent meta for credit card companies in the US is to give customers
either 1.5% cash back on everything, or 1% back on everything and 2-5% back on
specific categories.</p>

<p>The Apple Card gives 2% back on everything purchased through Apple Pay and 1%
on everything else, which is the best deal I've seen. (There are also some
merchants that do 3%, but I'm not about tracking and optimizing that.) Of the
purchases I make in Seattle, about 80% of shops and restaurants who do
pay-at-counter support Apple Pay, and about 20% of table-service restaurants
do. For online orders, roughly half of the non-Amazon orders I place support
it.</p>

<p>The experience of managing an Apple Card in Wallet is also the first credit
card experience that feels like it was made this century. The app is
beautiful, snappy, and simple.</p>

<p>{{ video "Drilling into Apple Card transactions using Wallet." "card" }}</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a living document.</p>

<p>Its goal is to document whether the Apple ecosystem is bigger than the sum of
its parts. It is. But the more interesting detail I’ve learned is that it’s
the long tail of ecosystem benefits that makes up most of that excess. Not the
two or three things per product I’ve mentioned above, but the dozens that
happen without me noticing that add up to make a more enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>I equate it to working in a clean space vs. a messy space. There are functional
benefits to working in a clean space---it’s easier to find things, spilling a
liquid is not as destructive, you breathe in less dust---but the bulk of the
benefit is in the hard-to-describe ways the space feels better and motivates
more.</p>

<p>As of 2022 May, I’m overall happy with the Apple ecosystem and would not count
it out from becoming my new preference. But, time will tell and I'll continue
to document my journey here.</p>

I recommend reading the subject article by C.L.&#xA;    Lynch,&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://neuroclastic.com/its-a-spectrum-doesnt-mean-what-you-think/&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;i&gt;&#34;Autism is a Spectrum&#34; Doesn&#39;t Mean What You Think&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;  &lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical.&#xA;  I have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and&#xA;  fighting climate change. I don&#39;t need support from others on a daily basis.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  And yet my psychologist, with 30 years of experience and a Ph.D. in clinical&#xA;  psychology, wrote it right there on my medical chart:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;Autism spectrum disorder&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is because behind the scenes, there&#39;s a &#34;me&#34; hardly anyone sees. It&#39;s the&#xA;  me who can be paralyzed by a&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29690399&#34;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/glcls/status/1273051092960440320&#34;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;  whose day is ruined if teeth-brushing and showering happen out of order, and&#xA;  who spends ~an hour a day performing internal conversation planning and&#xA;  retrospectives. It&#39;s the me who was mute for nine years.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It&#39;s also the me who was taught that all these qualities are just character&#xA;  flaws that can be willed away.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  You&#39;d never notice that me, because I hide him well. Of the folks with autism,&#xA;  I&#39;m not an outlier in doing that. In fact, 2% of all human beings have autism&#xA;  [1]. Statistically, you&#39;ve certainly met several of them without realizing it.&#xA;  Why is that, and what is it like to live that life?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Infamous Spectrum&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  We&#39;ve all heard &#34;autism is a spectrum&#34;. But that word, &#34;spectrum&#34;, in that&#xA;  context, has had its meaning lost to time. Often people think of folks with&#xA;  autism as &#34;high functioning&#34; or &#34;low functioning&#34;, as if these are positions&#xA;  on the spectrum. But a spectrum is not a scale. This is how to actually think&#xA;  about the autism spectrum:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;spectrum&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  There is no &#34;more&#34; or &#34;less&#34;; no &#34;high&#34; or &#34;low&#34;. There is only &#34;different&#34;.&#xA;  And yet people often still feel they&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it&#34;&gt;know it when they see it&lt;/a&gt;; that people with autism either act like Rain Man or don&#39;t, and that those&#xA;  are the two (if even that many) types of autism.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a&#xA;  glance?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Canary Symptom&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same&#xA;  hand. Of the many, the DSM-5 calls out a few examples:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote cite=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&#xA;    Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships,&#xA;    ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various&#xA;    social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making&#xA;    friends; to absence of interest in peers.&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html&#34;&gt;DSM-5&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Pay special attention to that first example, which I&#39;ll paraphrase as&#xA;  &#34;inability to change behavior based on social feedback&#34;. We&#39;ll come back to&#xA;  that later.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A Personal Example&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As&#xA;  cool as it sounds, this is no superpower. My body&#39;s defense systems will&#xA;  sometimes malfunction and miscalibrate incoming volume.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Imagine you&#39;re in a coffee shop reading a book when someone walks up to you,&#xA;  takes out an air horn, points it in your ear and briefly squeezes the trigger.&#xA;  What would your brain and body do instinctively? Would it startle, flinch,&#xA;  recoil? What if the person didn&#39;t go away, and kept squeezing the trigger&#xA;  randomly every few seconds? What if you looked around and slowly realized in&#xA;  horror that everyone else had their own air horn and they have all started&#xA;  doing the same?&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Your instinctive responses escalate to stress, panic, confusion. You keep&#xA;  trying to read your book but the air horns keep sounding and your body keeps&#xA;  flinching. You can&#39;t concentrate; your eyes are moving over the words in your&#xA;  book but you&#39;re not understanding them. You start getting annoyed at all the&#xA;  people wielding air horns&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;could they just not?! I&#39;m trying to read!&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is a hearing hypersensitivity. At random times, my brain will think every&#xA;  little sound is as loud as an air horn and it will execute all these&#xA;  physiological responses involuntarily. Even when I know it&#39;s a&#xA;  malfunction&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;which took me 30 years to learn&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;it&#39;s still just as&#xA;  hard as ever to get through a paragraph in that book, to not flinch, to not&#xA;  become stressed, to not panic. Even when I can rationally tell myself in the&#xA;  moment &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s all in your head&lt;/i&gt;, it doesn&#39;t stop the involuntary response.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  You may understand then why I and many other people with autism would, as&#xA;  children, collapse to the floor in public, cover their ears, and scream.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Killing the Canary&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  In many ways, I&#39;m one of the lucky ones. I didn&#39;t get dealt that &#34;inability to&#xA;  change behavior based on social feedback&#34; symptom, above. So when as a child I&#xA;  collapsed to the floor and screamed, and other people looked at me like I was&#xA;  losing it (reminder: I was) I can log that detail away, and work a little more&#xA;  towards avoiding it next time. I&#39;ve iterated on this quite a bit over 30&#xA;  years:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;On the floor screaming&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Ears covered, eyes shut, silent&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;On the floor cross-legged, teeth gritted, trying to dissociate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Fingers-in-ears, screaming interally&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Inventing excuses to stay home&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Going home&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same.&#xA;  During a hearing hypersensitivity, inside I&#39;m still that kid rolling on the&#xA;  floor screaming. The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;When the Canary Lives&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  People dealt the &#34;inability to change behavior based on social feedback&#34; card&#xA;  get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what&#xA;  the world thinks autism &#34;looks like&#34;; the canary symptom that reveals the&#xA;  rest.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  The people with this symptom, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking&#xA;  it, often need more support because our world is not built to accomodate them&#xA;  or understand them well. But they are not any more &#34;low-functioning&#34; than I am&#xA;  &#34;high-functioning&#34;. Those words are descriptions of how &lt;em&gt;observers&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;  experience autism, not how autism-havers do. That&#39;s why those terms have&#xA;  fallen out of use since the DSM-5.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Masking&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This ability to fake not having autism is called &lt;b&gt;masking&lt;/b&gt;. Those of us&#xA;  who can mask&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;those without the canary symptom&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;mask in virtually&#xA;  every social situation.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  This is not a temporary &#34;get to know me and I&#39;ll stop masking&#34; deal; I mask in&#xA;  front of my mom, my spouse, my psychologist. It&#39;s like an emulation layer that&#xA;  sits on top of my brain so I can run programs that let me communicate with&#xA;  others, programs like &#34;talking&#34; and &#34;facial expressions&#34; and &#34;not losing it&#34;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It&#39;s not that I feel forced to do these things. It&#39;s just that I am a human&#xA;  being, so I crave social interaction. I love my friends and family and I enjoy&#xA;  interacting with them, and this is how I have to do it. I just wish we ran the&#xA;  same architecture, because masking is&#xA;  &lt;em&gt;exhausting&lt;/em&gt; [2]. My brain overclocks itself just running this&#xA;  emulation layer. It reallocates important resources from other programs like&#xA;  reason and problem-solving. I literally become dumber when I am with others.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every&#xA;  day is &#34;unmasking&#34;, which I&#39;d equate to the feeling of getting home from a&#xA;  long trip and flopping down on your own bed. Masking is a great tool and being&#xA;  able to use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory&#34;&gt;extra toll&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Flying Under the Radar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  One risk of masking is going your whole life undiagnosed. You don&#39;t have to&#xA;  know you&#39;re masking to mask. Historically most autism diagnoses are in&#xA;  children, which is no coincidence&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;if you happen to slip past childhood&#xA;  without a diagnosis, chances are good that you&#39;re old enough to have learned&#xA;  masking, which can hide your autism forever. I narrowly avoided this fate. I&#xA;  missed diagnosis during my childhood window and it was 30 years until my&#xA;  eventual adult diagnosis, which happened more by chance than anything.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  It sounds silly in retrospect to spend so much effort masking and dealing with&#xA;  other issues without realizing that other people don&#39;t, but it&#39;s difficult to&#xA;  identify atypicality when you&#39;ve only ever piloted one brain.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Rough Self-Check&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Medical help is the best way to find answers. But in the real world not&#xA;  everybody has access to it due to things like family, income, benefits, or&#xA;  location. It&#39;s therefore common to find people in the autism community who&#xA;  identify as self-diagnosed; they are pretty sure they have some form of autism&#xA;  based on how well others&#39; stories resonate with them, but they&#39;re either&#xA;  unwilling or unable to confirm that with a medical professional.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Even for those who are willing and able, going from ignorance to &#34;Oh! That&#xA;  happens to me too!&#34; is often the kick-start needed to seek professional&#xA;  attention. Therefore I present for your benefit a small list of&#xA;  non-professional, non-medical autism indicators that may warrant, at minimum,&#xA;  further investigation:&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&#xA;    Occasional or constant annoyance at typically unannoying things like touch,&#xA;    light, or sound (sensory hypersensitivies)&#xA;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&#xA;    More than your peers, a need to dig into what people say by asking&#xA;    clarifying questions (difficulty dealing with ambiguity)&#xA;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Eliminating all facial expression when exiting a room (masking)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;More confusion about social conventions than your peers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  If these resonate with you, consider it a starting point to slingshot yourself&#xA;  into more research and, if available to you, seek a professional.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More People than You Think&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Two percent of people have autism. There is no &#34;high-functioning&#34; or&#xA;  &#34;low-functioning&#34; autism, because autism is a deck of cards full of symptoms,&#xA;  and each hand is different. One possible symptom is a canary that reveals the&#xA;  others, but not everybody has this symptom. For those who don&#39;t, there is a&#xA;  different set of challenges, often had in private and unfortunately, often&#xA;  taken to the grave.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Be open about your own brain: what does it do well?

      <i>"Autism is a Spectrum" Doesn't Mean What You Think</i></a>.

</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  I have autism. If you know me, that might surprise you. I appear neurotypical.
  I have a career, a marriage, and a social life. I like playing video games and
  fighting climate change. I don't need support from others on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
  And yet my psychologist, with 30 years of experience and a Ph.D. in clinical
  psychology, wrote it right there on my medical chart:
</p>
<blockquote>Autism spectrum disorder</blockquote>
<p>
  This is because behind the scenes, there's a "me" hardly anyone sees. It's the
  me who can be paralyzed by a
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29690399">text</a>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/glcls/status/1273051092960440320">message</a>,
  whose day is ruined if teeth-brushing and showering happen out of order, and
  who spends ~an hour a day performing internal conversation planning and
  retrospectives. It's the me who was mute for nine years.
</p>

<p>
  It's also the me who was taught that all these qualities are just character
  flaws that can be willed away.
</p>
<p>
  You'd never notice that me, because I hide him well. Of the folks with autism,
  I'm not an outlier in doing that. In fact, 2% of all human beings have autism
  [1]. Statistically, you've certainly met several of them without realizing it.
  Why is that, and what is it like to live that life?
</p>
<h2>The Infamous Spectrum</h2>
<p>
  We've all heard "autism is a spectrum". But that word, "spectrum", in that
  context, has had its meaning lost to time. Often people think of folks with
  autism as "high functioning" or "low functioning", as if these are positions
  on the spectrum. But a spectrum is not a scale. This is how to actually think
  about the autism spectrum:
</p>
<p>
  </p><center><div class="spectrum"> </div></center>
<p></p>
<p>
  There is no "more" or "less"; no "high" or "low". There is only "different".
  And yet people often still feel they
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">know it when they see it</a>; that people with autism either act like Rain Man or don't, and that those
  are the two (if even that many) types of autism.
</p>
<p>
  What, really, is this subset of autism people think they can identify at a
  glance?
</p>
<h2>The Canary Symptom</h2>
<p>
  Autism symptoms are a deck of cards, and not all folks are dealt the same
  hand. Of the many, the DSM-5 calls out a few examples:
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">
  <p>
    Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand [sic] relationships,
    ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various
    social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making
    friends; to absence of interest in peers.
  </p>
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html">DSM-5</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Pay special attention to that first example, which I'll paraphrase as
  "inability to change behavior based on social feedback". We'll come back to
  that later.
</p>
<h3>A Personal Example</h3>
<p>
  One symptom I got dealt in my autism hand is a hearing hypersensitivity. As
  cool as it sounds, this is no superpower. My body's defense systems will
  sometimes malfunction and miscalibrate incoming volume.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you're in a coffee shop reading a book when someone walks up to you,
  takes out an air horn, points it in your ear and briefly squeezes the trigger.
  What would your brain and body do instinctively? Would it startle, flinch,
  recoil? What if the person didn't go away, and kept squeezing the trigger
  randomly every few seconds? What if you looked around and slowly realized in
  horror that everyone else had their own air horn and they have all started
  doing the same?
</p>
<p>
  Your instinctive responses escalate to stress, panic, confusion. You keep
  trying to read your book but the air horns keep sounding and your body keeps
  flinching. You can't concentrate; your eyes are moving over the words in your
  book but you're not understanding them. You start getting annoyed at all the
  people wielding air horns<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span><i>could they just not?! I'm trying to read!</i>
</p>
<p>
  This is a hearing hypersensitivity. At random times, my brain will think every
  little sound is as loud as an air horn and it will execute all these
  physiological responses involuntarily. Even when I know it's a
  malfunction<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>which took me 30 years to learn<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>it's still just as
  hard as ever to get through a paragraph in that book, to not flinch, to not
  become stressed, to not panic. Even when I can rationally tell myself in the
  moment <i>It's all in your head</i>, it doesn't stop the involuntary response.
</p>
<p>
  You may understand then why I and many other people with autism would, as
  children, collapse to the floor in public, cover their ears, and scream.
</p>
<h3>Killing the Canary</h3>
<p>
  In many ways, I'm one of the lucky ones. I didn't get dealt that "inability to
  change behavior based on social feedback" symptom, above. So when as a child I
  collapsed to the floor and screamed, and other people looked at me like I was
  losing it (reminder: I was) I can log that detail away, and work a little more
  towards avoiding it next time. I've iterated on this quite a bit over 30
  years:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the floor screaming</li>
  <li>Ears covered, eyes shut, silent</li>
  <li>On the floor cross-legged, teeth gritted, trying to dissociate</li>
  <li>Fingers-in-ears, screaming interally</li>
  <li>Inventing excuses to stay home</li>
  <li>Going home</li>
</ol>
<p>
  My actions are more socially acceptable now, but the sensation is the same.
  During a hearing hypersensitivity, inside I'm still that kid rolling on the
  floor screaming. The only difference is that I have learned to fake it away.
</p>
<h3>When the Canary Lives</h3>
<p>
  People dealt the "inability to change behavior based on social feedback" card
  get stuck on the rolling-on-the-floor-screaming phase. This, perhaps, is what
  the world thinks autism "looks like"; the canary symptom that reveals the
  rest.
</p>
<p>
  The people with this symptom, who commit the cardinal sin of simply not faking
  it, often need more support because our world is not built to accomodate them
  or understand them well. But they are not any more "low-functioning" than I am
  "high-functioning". Those words are descriptions of how <em>observers</em>
  experience autism, not how autism-havers do. That's why those terms have
  fallen out of use since the DSM-5.
</p>
<h2>Masking</h2>
<p>
  This ability to fake not having autism is called <b>masking</b>. Those of us
  who can mask<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>those without the canary symptom<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>mask in virtually
  every social situation.
</p>
<p>
  This is not a temporary "get to know me and I'll stop masking" deal; I mask in
  front of my mom, my spouse, my psychologist. It's like an emulation layer that
  sits on top of my brain so I can run programs that let me communicate with
  others, programs like "talking" and "facial expressions" and "not losing it".
</p>
<p>
  It's not that I feel forced to do these things. It's just that I am a human
  being, so I crave social interaction. I love my friends and family and I enjoy
  interacting with them, and this is how I have to do it. I just wish we ran the
  same architecture, because masking is
  <em>exhausting</em> [2]. My brain overclocks itself just running this
  emulation layer. It reallocates important resources from other programs like
  reason and problem-solving. I literally become dumber when I am with others.
</p>
<p>
  For these reasons, people with autism generally agree the best part of every
  day is "unmasking", which I'd equate to the feeling of getting home from a
  long trip and flopping down on your own bed. Masking is a great tool and being
  able to use it is a blessing, but it means every day takes an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">extra toll</a>.
</p>
<h3>Flying Under the Radar</h3>
<p>
  One risk of masking is going your whole life undiagnosed. You don't have to
  know you're masking to mask. Historically most autism diagnoses are in
  children, which is no coincidence<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>if you happen to slip past childhood
  without a diagnosis, chances are good that you're old enough to have learned
  masking, which can hide your autism forever. I narrowly avoided this fate. I
  missed diagnosis during my childhood window and it was 30 years until my
  eventual adult diagnosis, which happened more by chance than anything.
</p>
<p>
  It sounds silly in retrospect to spend so much effort masking and dealing with
  other issues without realizing that other people don't, but it's difficult to
  identify atypicality when you've only ever piloted one brain.
</p>
<h3>The Rough Self-Check</h3>
<p>
  Medical help is the best way to find answers. But in the real world not
  everybody has access to it due to things like family, income, benefits, or
  location. It's therefore common to find people in the autism community who
  identify as self-diagnosed; they are pretty sure they have some form of autism
  based on how well others' stories resonate with them, but they're either
  unwilling or unable to confirm that with a medical professional.
</p>
<p>
  Even for those who are willing and able, going from ignorance to "Oh! That
  happens to me too!" is often the kick-start needed to seek professional
  attention. Therefore I present for your benefit a small list of
  non-professional, non-medical autism indicators that may warrant, at minimum,
  further investigation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Occasional or constant annoyance at typically unannoying things like touch,
    light, or sound (sensory hypersensitivies)
  </li>
  <li>
    More than your peers, a need to dig into what people say by asking
    clarifying questions (difficulty dealing with ambiguity)
  </li>
  <li>Eliminating all facial expression when exiting a room (masking)</li>
  <li>More confusion about social conventions than your peers</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If these resonate with you, consider it a starting point to slingshot yourself
  into more research and, if available to you, seek a professional.
</p>
<h2>More People than You Think</h2>
<p>
  Two percent of people have autism. There is no "high-functioning" or
  "low-functioning" autism, because autism is a deck of cards full of symptoms,
  and each hand is different. One possible symptom is a canary that reveals the
  others, but not everybody has this symptom. For those who don't, there is a
  different set of challenges, often had in private and unfortunately, often
  taken to the grave.
</p>
<p>
  Be open about your own brain: what does it do well? What does it do poorly?
  Like sharing salary information, we can't know what our situation is until we
  normalize talking about it.

  This year, I got a tattoo. My morals had been at odds with my behaviors in a
  place very important to me<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>the climate crisis. It’s easy to think about how
  horrible the climate crisis is, and yes definitely someone should do something

  forget about it for another year.
</p>
<p>
  This isn’t a great way to get things done and I had the cognizance to
  recognize that, but it kept happening to me. So I tattooed a reminder on my

      <title>The Remote Pop-In</title>

It&#39;s interruptive to be popped in&#xA;  on, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of physically&#xA;  going somewhere is high, and the tools available to the target like doors,&#xA;  signs, and social cues are numerous and don&#39;t require much thought to&#xA;  implement.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  Slack DMs come close to replacing the pop-in, but they reduce the effort too&#xA;  much. This leads to more interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot&#xA;  higher in number) and even to the replacement of trackers, emails, and wikis&#xA;  with DMs.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  There&#39;s a lot wrong with the pop-in, but like any tool it has its uses. Many&#xA;  great products&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;companies, even&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: sans-serif&#34;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;have been built on the shoulders of&#xA;  the pop-in.&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Remote Pop-In&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  There&#39;s really no remote equivalent to the pop-in.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><h1>The Remote Pop-In</h1>

<p>
  This page describes a method of dealing with one of the missing features of
  fully remote teams: the pop-in.

  <!-- TODO: make another about social time re: hallway conversations -->
</p>

<h2>The Pop-In</h2>
<p>
  The pop-in, back before open floorplans, is when you physically walk into
  someone's office to ask them a question or spitball an idea. In an open
  floorplan you can instead swivel your chair or walk to their desk.
</p>
<p>
  The pop-in is valuable because it's as informal as email, but as
  high-bandwidth and low-latency as meetings. It's interruptive to be popped in
  on, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of physically
  going somewhere is high, and the tools available to the target like doors,
  signs, and social cues are numerous and don't require much thought to
  implement.
</p>
<p>
  Slack DMs come close to replacing the pop-in, but they reduce the effort too
  much. This leads to more interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot
  higher in number) and even to the replacement of trackers, emails, and wikis
  with DMs.
</p>
<p>
  There's a lot wrong with the pop-in, but like any tool it has its uses. Many
  great products<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>companies, even<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>have been built on the shoulders of
  the pop-in.
</p>
<h2>The Remote Pop-In</h2>
<p>
  There's really no remote equivalent to the pop-in. There are products that
  help you "hang out" like Facebook Portal, but nothing that implements the
  pop-in.
</p>
<p>
  At <a href="https://yourbase.io">YourBase</a> we decided we needed one. Rather
  than build another tool, we experimented with Discord. I'm happy to say we
  found something that works, and even solves the worst problem of the
  open-office pop-in: the inability to shut your damned door.
</p>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
{{ img
  "The company Discord server on a workday."
  "0"
  "A screenshot of a Discord server with several voice channels, some empty, some having one person in them"
}}
<p>
  In our company Discord server, we give everyone one voice channel of their
  own. This is your "office". When you are online and able to be disturbed, you
  join your office, alone. You stay in there as long as you are "in".
</p>
<p>
  Because of how Discord works, everyone can see who is in what office at all
  times. But you can only hear conversations for the room you're in, and you can
  only be in one room at a time. Joining a room plays an obvious audio chime and
  is not something you can do sneakily.
</p>
<p>
  When someone wants to pop in, they join your voice channel. The chime plays,
  they say hello, you unmute and turn on video if you like, and have your
  pop-in. And that's really it.
</p>
<p>
  If you're going to the restroom and will be AFK, you can join the restroom
  channel. You're in, but away. No one is actually wearing a headset on the
  toilet, it's just a fun way to feel like a real office.
</p>
<p>We've even fallen into some typical office behaviors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We've started having meetings in people's offices, just because it's easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a "cafeteria" room where you can eat your lunch if you've got
    nothing going on in real life. We also hold lunch-and-learns here.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a "rooftop" and other common spaces where some people chill, which
    signals that they're open for a chat.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The oddest one is that when it's slow around the office, you can tell. You can
  almost hear how quiet it is when you're the first one in or the last one out.
</p>
<p>
  The pop-in is valuable because it's informal, high bandwidth, and low latency.
  Enabling it using Discord has worked very well for us over the last six
  months, and we didn't even have to build anything.
</p>
