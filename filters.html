<p>In astronomy we sometimes talk about Great Filters.
If you already know what Great Filters are, you can skip to the fifth paragraph.</p>

<p>Great Filters are a possible solution to the Fermi paradox.
(If you know what the Fermi paradox is, skip this paragraph.)
The Fermi paradox is the idea that based on the number of stars we know exist,
the probabilities of each having a habitable planet,
the rough odds of life having developed there, and so on;
we should have heard from an alien civilization by now.</p>

<p>It’s possible we’re the first one with the ability to send information other civilizations might receive,
but the odds are astronomically low.</p>

<p>A Great Filter is a concept that answers this paradox.
It says the reason we haven’t heard from any civilizations more advanced than ours is that every civilization,
when it advances to some specific point,
hits a wall that stops it.</p>

<p>Usually, the ideas for what that wall could be are extinction-level events.
Some examples are nuclear war, climate change, hyperintelligent AI that murders us all, uncontrollable plague, or exhaustion of resources.
There’s a lot of talk about Great Filters as a concept,
but less about specific Great Filters that we might one day reach.</p>

<p>That’s disappointing, because anticipating these obstacles is an important first step to overcoming or avoiding them.
I’m no astrophysicist, but I’ve thought a lot about this.
Here are some candidates I’ve never heard discussed.</p>

<h2>Sub-replacement Reproduction</h2>

<p>As populations advance, birth rates decline.
Contraceptives, family planning, education, they all stand in the way of reproduction.</p>

<p>When each person on average produces 1.0 children,
this is called <em>replacement</em>.
Historically this has been very easy, and it is why we are now 8 billion strong.
It turns out when the process that makes children is fun, children get made.</p>

<p>But do we, as individuals, even want replacement?
I don't know a single person who plans for their children to outnumber them.</p>

<p>It's possible we develop<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>or have already developed<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>into an inclination where,
on average, humans want <code>&lt; 1</code> children each.
It's possible we've been there emotionally for a long time,
and just hadn't developed the contraceptive means and distribution to achieve it.</p>

<p>We're going to get there. Soon.
And it's a good thing that every individual human has access to contraceptives.
But it also might end the species.</p>

<p>Perhaps we’re the most populous generation of humans the universe will ever see, and it will just go down from here.
Perhaps this has already happened to countless other species on countless other worlds.
Lack of birth control is an evolutionary necessity,
so once a species advances enough to fix that,
evolution can’t do its job.
Great Filter found, species over.</p>

<h1>Low Desire for Development</h1>

<p>Humans are unique on the planet for two related reasons. First, we’re toolmakers. Second, we pine for more. More everything. I’m not criticizing here, just making an observation. The richest among us, on the whole, still want more. This carnal desire has brought us far evolutionarily, intellectually, and economically.</p>

<p>Maybe we’ll grow out of it. Maybe we’ll realize there’s no point in optimizing for excess, for GDP, for efficiency. Maybe we’ll reach some philosophical understanding of the universe and our own nature that permanently stunts us at whatever our current advancement level will be.</p>

<p>The ability for a species to advance might be deeply entwined with its tendency to desire excess. Perhaps the tendency to desire excess is entwined with a delayed philosophical realization that our desire for excess causes issues, and can be overcome.</p>

<p>Maybe it has happened to countless of species on countless worlds already, and maybe they’ve overcome it, ceasing extraplanetary operations and living out the lives they have on the planet they grew up on, solarpunk style.</p>

<p>TODO: Insert chill solarpunk illustration.</p>

<p>Terminal Capitalist Hellscape</p>

<p>Maybe the logical end state of capitalism is not what we think. Maybe it’s a cyberpunk future where corporations run amok (in a more existentially dangerous way than today) and either stunt our growth permanently, or accidentally make us extinct.</p>

<p>Destroyed by a System We’re Unwittingly Part of</p>

<p>Atoms are tiny, but also huge. The configuration of atoms is so varied that any substance you’ve ever come in contact with can be represented by just adding or subtracting some protons or electrons. The charges surrounding them and their neighbors interact in complex ways to make beautiful, large things.</p>

<p>Cells are tiny, but also huge. There are 100 trillion atoms in a cell. It’s an astonishingly complex system.</p>

<p>Humans are huge, but also tiny. They make towns and governments, and social groups and businesses.</p>

<p>Countries are huge, but also tiny.</p>

<p>Maybe the Earth is tiny, but also huge. Maybe we’re just like the bacteria in our gut<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>living out life in the only world we’ve ever known, responding to stimuli, not knowing much about what’s Out There. Maybe Out There is some extraplanetary or extrauniversal organism, or system, or process, and we’re just a tiny little cog in a machine of hundreds of trillions.</p>

<p>Maybe, like bacteria, one day this giant system or organism will take a pill, or vomit, or drink something acidic, or die, and we’ll be gone by some means we never saw coming and will never know. Maybe we’re a cancer cell and we’re helping hurt someone or something.</p>

<p>Everyone Left</p>

<p>Maybe every civilization advanced to the point where they found a way out. Out of our universe, or our of our spatial dimensions. Maybe they discovered time travel and there’s some reason they really wanted to use it, so they time traveled their entire civilization far into the future, like past the heat death of the universe.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s what dark energy is<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>planets or star systems or galaxies that are “currently” time traveling from the past into the future. If you imagine spacetime like a two-dimensional piece of fabric, maybe they were weighing it down so deeply and then poof disappeared from it, leaving the fabric to spring back upwards and disturb everything around it.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s what time travel is. Taking the fake-two-dimensional fabric of spacetime and pulling it up instead of weight it down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every civilization so far has discovered forward time travel and also discovered something they’d like to skip over, e.g. the heat death of the universe, so they have time-traveled their entire empires out of the present.

<ul>
<li>Maybe this is what dark matter is. Empires that are “currently” time traveling from the past into the future.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There’s No Filter, We Just Aren’t Perceptually Compatible</p>

<p>Maybe everything is perfect and many extraterrestrial civilizations exist, just in ways we can’t perceive, and maybe they equally cannot perceive us. Maybe they are what dark matter is. Maybe there are entire empires spread across the galaxies thriving, but they somehow exist and have always existed in a perceptual corner of the universe we don’t even know about, like radio waves in the 1700s.</p>

<p>Would It Be Bad to be Filtered?</p>
