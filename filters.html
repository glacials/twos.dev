<p>Great Filters are a possible solution to the Fermi paradox.
The Fermi paradox is the idea that based on the number of stars in the universe,
the probabilities of each having a habitable planet,
the rough odds of life having developed there, and so on;
statistically it's virtually certain some other civilization has become obscenely advanced,
far beyond our own.</p>

<p>If such a civilization exists we should have heard from them by now, but we haven't.
That's the paradox.</p>

<p>The Great Filter is one solution to this paradox.
It proposes that every advanced civilization hits some wall that stops it,
the same wall every time.</p>

<p>Usually, ideas for possible Great Filters are extinction-level events.
Nuclear war, climate change, hyperintelligent AI, plague, exhaustion of resources.</p>

<p>I'd like to propose some less popular alternatives.</p>

<h2>Stopped Having Happy Accidents</h2>

<p>We already know that as populations develop, birth rates decline.
Contraceptives, family planning, education, individual freedoms, and opportunity
all work together to create more thoughtful and intentional individual reproduction.</p>

<p>When speaking about population levels, an average person producing 1.0 children is called <strong>replacement</strong>.
Mathematically, it's vital to the continuation of the species that we are at or above replacement.
An average production of even 0.9 children per person means each generation is smaller than the last,
until there is simply no next generation.</p>

<p>Historically, reaching replacement has been easy. It's why we are 8 billion strong.
It turns out when the process that makes children is fun, children get made.</p>

<p>But if we reach a world where every child is planned<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>no "oopsies"<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>would we even be <em>close</em> to replacement?</p>

<p>Do you know any couples who <em>plan</em> to have 3+ children,
or any other configuration that would beat replacement?
I bet your social circle is biased towards the first world,
but it's only a matter of time before those freedoms become available to everyone.</p>

<p>It's a good thing we're working towards that.
Also, it might end the species.</p>

<p>It may have already ended other species.
Perhaps we’re the most populous generation of humans the universe will ever see, and it will just go down from here.
Lack of birth control is an evolutionary necessity,
so perhaps once a species advances enough to fix it, that's the end.</p>

<h2>Never Developed the Tools to be Heard</h2>

<p>Humans are unique on the planet for two reasons.
First, we’re toolmakers.
Second, we pine for more.
More everything.
The richest among us still want more.
This carnal desire has brought us far evolutionarily, intellectually, and economically.</p>

<p>Maybe we’ll grow out of it.
Maybe we’ll realize there’s no point in optimizing for excess, for GDP, for efficiency.
Maybe we’ll reach some philosophical understanding of the universe and our own nature that shuts down that optimization,
that makes every human being happy and healthy but doesn't also advance science,
or at least spacefaring science.</p>

<p>Maybe that will be a good thing.</p>

<p>The ability for a species to advance might be deeply entwined with its tendency to desire excess.
Perhaps the tendency to desire excess is entwined with a delayed philosophical realization that our desire for excess causes issues, and can be overcome.</p>

<p>Maybe it has happened to countless species on countless worlds already,
and maybe they’ve overcome it,
ceasing extraplanetary operations and living out the lives they have on the planet they grew up on,
solarpunk style.</p>

<h2>Thrust into a Capitalist Hellscape</h2>

<p>Maybe the logical end state of capitalism is not what we think.
Maybe it’s a cyberpunk future where corporations run amok
(in a more existentially dangerous way than today)
and either stunt our growth permanently,
or accidentally make us extinct.</p>

<h2>Destroyed by its Greater System</h2>

<p>We're only starting to understand the complexity of the gut biome.
It is an entire colony of bacteria<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a civilization, you might say<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>that operates inside us in symbiosis.</p>

<p>The bacteria in the biome probably don't "know" that their world is inside a person,
who lives in an ever larger world.</p>

<p>Maybe we're someone else's gut biome;
a civilization unknowingly making up part of some larger being.
Maybe that larger being has some defense mechanism,
like we have white blood cells,
that hunts down and destroys worlds that get into a bad state.</p>

<h2>Left</h2>

<p>Maybe every civilization advanced to the point where they found a way out.
Out of our universe, or our of our spatial dimensions.
Maybe they discovered time travel and there’s some reason they really wanted to use it, so they time traveled their entire civilization far into the future, like past the heat death of the universe.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s what dark energy is<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>planets or star systems or galaxies that are “currently” time traveling from the past into the future.
If you imagine spacetime like a two-dimensional piece of fabric, maybe they were weighing it down so deeply and then poof disappeared from it, leaving the fabric to spring back upwards and disturb everything around it.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s what time travel is.
Taking the fake-two-dimensional fabric of spacetime and pulling it up instead of weight it down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every civilization so far has discovered forward time travel and also discovered something they’d like to skip over, e.g. the heat death of the universe, so they have time-traveled their entire empires out of the present.

<ul>
<li>Maybe this is what dark matter is. Empires that are “currently” time traveling from the past into the future.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>There’s No Filter, We Just Aren’t Perceptually Compatible</h1>

<p>Maybe everything is perfect and many extraterrestrial civilizations exist, just in ways we can’t perceive, and maybe they equally cannot perceive us.
Maybe they are what dark matter is.
Maybe there are entire empires spread across the galaxies thriving, but they somehow exist and have always existed in a perceptual corner of the universe we don’t even know about, like radio waves in the 1700s.</p>
