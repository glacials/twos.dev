<p>Summer and I recently stayed a few weeks with her parents in Harbin, China.</p>

<p><a href="/img/china-harbin.png"><img src="/img/china-harbin.png" alt="A satellite map zoomed out to see most of china. Harbin is circled in the far northeast."/></a></p>

<p>Harbin is near the northern border, far from the popular coastal cities.</p>

<p>A few things caught me off guard about the culture.
Things nobody really talks about,
things even Summer remarked that she'd never thought about,
but that affected my stay in subtle ways.</p>

<h2>Natural Refrigeration</h2>

<p>Kitchens this far north use their pantries as natural refrigerators, with the framing of the building set to expose 2<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>3 pantry walls to the exterior.</p>

<p>

				  <img alt="Another photo of the same, but a different building." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-pantries6.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>More exposed surface area means more and faster cooling.</p>

<p>

			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of a wire rack with vegetables laying on it, like cabbage and green onions." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-pantry.jpeg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a wire rack with vegetables laying on it, like cabbage and green onions." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-pantry.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>The pantry can be used to both cool and dry food.</p>

<p>Summer shared a half-joke that if you want a cold beer in the winter,
you get it from the pantry.
If you want a warm one, you get it from the refrigerator.</p>

<h2>Hot Water</h2>

<p>People in China drink their water hot, not cold, especially older generations.
The tap water is not potable, so you have to sterilize it by boiling it.
After generations of this, people prefer their water hot<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>even as filtering has become mainstream.</p>

<p>It's even embedded in traditional Chinese medicine that drinking hot water is necessary to restore your body's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang" target="_blank"><em>yang</em></a>,
and drinking cold water should be avoided.</p>

<p>And for what it's worth,
for <em>years</em> after coming to the US Summer would get stomachaches after drinking cold water,
especially on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>Whether physiological or psychosomatic it was clear the routine has an effect on a person,
so I don't exactly blame anyone for the preference or belief.</p>

<p>It was a constant effort to convince her family I wasn't harming myself by drinking cold water.</p>

<h2>Smoking</h2>

<p>Smoking is huge in China.
China consumes about half of all cigarattes globally.</p>

<p>Smoking in restaurants is technically banned, but everyone does it because there's no enforcement.
There's also no incentive to enforce it because tobacco is nationalized, bringing in ~7% of all government revenue.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:https-www-theexa"><a href="#fn:https-www-theexa">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Like hot water, the tradition is stronger in older generations.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>The food was by far the best part of China,
though I've had a few years to acclimate my taste to authentic Chinese food in Seattle and Vancouver.</p>

<p>Some notable items I tried:</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of a clear bottle of gold-colored fizzy liquid, with a label depicting a loaf of bread." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-breadsoda.jpg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a clear bottle of gold-colored fizzy liquid, with a label depicting a loaf of bread." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-breadsoda.jpg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Bread soda, with real yeast. My stomach doesn't recommend more than one at a time.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of a small disposable bowl of wide noodles with veggies mixed in. In the background is a night market." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-kaolengmian.jpeg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of a small disposable bowl of wide noodles with veggies mixed in. In the background is a night market." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-kaolengmian.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>烤冷面 kǎolěngmiàn ("grilled cold noodles"), my years-long favorite Chinese food.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of me, a white man, dipping a long donut-looking item in a cup of soy milk. We are sitting at a table on the street and the sun is rising." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-youtiao.jpeg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of me, a white man, dipping a long donut-looking item in a cup of soy milk. We are sitting at a table on the street and the sun is rising." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-youtiao.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Plain donuts (油条 yóutiáo) dipped in soy milk (豆浆 dòujiāng), a common if unhealthy breakfast.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of seemingly normal cheese pizza." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-pizza.jpeg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of seemingly normal cheese pizza." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-pizza.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Pizza Hut is a pseudodelicacy in China, similar to sushi in the US.
It looks the same, but this pizza uses cream cheese and has a sweet, oily crust.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of an egg tart in KFC packaging." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-kfc.jpeg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of an egg tart in KFC packaging." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-kfc.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>KFC sells egg tarts and a few other Chinese items.
Neither of us enjoyed them, but it was interesting exploring international chains' local menus.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of yumi lao, which looks like like (and is) a sugary mass of fried corn." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-yumilao.jpeg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of yumi lao, which looks like like (and is) a sugary mass of fried corn." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-yumilao.jpeg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Fried corn fritters (玉米烙 yùmǐlào) are a sweet cross between popcorn, kettle corn, and corn.
If you like those flavors, you'll love these.</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>No one carries cash in China;
businesses universally accept and expect pay-by-phone.
But there’s no tap-to-pay.</p>

<p>Instead, businesses have QR codes posted on their walls that point to WeChat accounts.
The cashier tells you how much to pay and you send it over the internet,
like a Venmo payment.</p>

<p>A nearby speaker announces incoming payment amounts automatically,
signaling to the shopkeeper that payment was received.</p>

<h2>City Limits</h2>

<p>Before we left Seattle,
Summer kept repeating to me that Harbin is a small town.</p>

<p>What she neglected to mention was that the population of this "small town" was <em>10 million</em>.
At first I attributed the number to China simply having 1.4 billion people,
which is 1.1 billion more than I'm used to conceptualizing.</p>

<p>There's a different explanation though,
and it is caused by a series of imperfect translations:
China has no suburbs.
Everything is city.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="The city limits of New York, NY, USA overlaid on the city limits of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. New York City's city limits are tiny in comparison, only about 2% of the size." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-ny.png" title=""/>
				  <img alt="The city limits of New York, NY, USA overlaid on the city limits of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. New York City's city limits are tiny in comparison, only about 2% of the size." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-ny.png" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>New York City (solid red, superimposed) is ~2% the area of Harbin (dotted red).</p>

<p>There is plenty of rural land.
It's just that every square centimeter of it is technically in a city.
Chinese cities have boundaries more akin to US counties or metropolitan areas.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Officially-it-is"><a href="#fn:Officially-it-is">2</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, take Beijing:</p>

<p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/charts.min.css"/>

<p>Beijing more resembles Greater New York<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>a conglomeration of over 70 cities<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>than it does New York City.
A similar pattern holds for most Chinese cities.</p>

<h2>Westerners in Social Media</h2>

<p>I'm very white.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A photo of me and Summer dressed up at a nice dinner. I am white. Summer is Chinese. We are both laughing and I am showing the 'sign of the horns'." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-white.jpg" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A photo of me and Summer dressed up at a nice dinner. I am white. Summer is Chinese. We are both laughing and I am showing the 'sign of the horns'." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-white.jpg" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Me and Summer.</p>

<p>Most people in China this far north don't really see white people.
After two weeks walking the busy streets of Harbin,
which has an (albeit small) international airport,
I identified only one other non-Chinese person.</p>

<p>In Daqing, two hours away by car,
children in the street stopped playing to stare at me.
At the only Daqing restaurant we went to,
several tables stared and one struck up a conversation with me.</p>

<p>Summer’s family had never met an American,
but they had been exposed to the worst of the tropes and stereotypes on social media,
mostly about the extreme political right.
They were surprised by my kindness, politeness, and sunny disposition.</p>

<h2>Sewage</h2>

<p>It's not omnipresent, but every few dozen breaths carry a sewage smell.
Chinese plumbing tends not to use traps, which are plumbing tricks that prevent smells from traveling backwards up sewer lines.</p>

<p>
				<label class="gallery-item">
			    <input type="checkbox"/>
					<img alt="A sketch of two types of traps, which look like capital 'N' shapes where the water comes in the top-right of the 'N' and leaves the bottom-left of it, leaving the middle section always full with a buffer of water, preventing air from traveling from the bottom-left to the top-right." class="thumbnail" src="/img/china-trap.png" title=""/>
				  <img alt="A sketch of two types of traps, which look like capital 'N' shapes where the water comes in the top-right of the 'N' and leaves the bottom-left of it, leaving the middle section always full with a buffer of water, preventing air from traveling from the bottom-left to the top-right." class="fullsize" src="/img/china-trap.png" title=""/>
				</label></p>

<p>Traps make pipes airtight but not watertight. (Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vattenlaas.png" target="_blank">Nordisk Familjebok, 1921</a>)</p>

<p>Traps are all over the place in western plumbing but virtually nowhere in Chinese plumbing,
and you can tell within a couple of hours of landing.
Trapless systems can be retrofitted with aftermarket trap-ish attachments,
but the one we tried drained prohibitively slowly
so was effectively a manual plug.</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but you get used to the smell.</p>

<h2>Surveillance</h2>

<p>Cameras are everywhere, literally multiple on every street corner.
People like them because they make them feel safe,
and indeed walking around the city at night does feel surprisingly safe.</p>

<p>As someone raised in the US, married to someone raised in China,
this is the summary on this subject we've reached over the years:</p>

<ol>
<li>People raised in the US value freedom.</li>
<li>People raised in China value safety.</li>
<li>People raised in the US are apalled that anyone would live in a surveillance state.</li>
<li>People raised in China are apalled that anyone would live in a gun state.</li>
<li>When people raised in the US go to China, their friends and family worry for them.</li>
<li>When people raised in China go to the US, their friends and family worry for them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pointing this out doesn't forgive either side for its issues,
or even claim the issues are equal in importance.
But it's interesting to see the same emotions come from concerned Chinese people towards the US,
as come from concerned Americans towards China.</p>

<p>Maybe both are valid, or maybe not.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd opt for the one without a reputation for carefully crafting its own truths.
But even that reasoning is influenced by where I happened to be raised.</p>

<p>Would I have the same preference if I were raised elsewhere?
I'd like to think so, and people who know my neutral good side would agree.
But we can't possibly be sure.
Identifying bias doesn't disarm it.</p>

<h2>In Sum</h2>

<p>The few weeks we stayed with Summer's parents in Harbin were educational for me.
A few things caught me off guard,
things I'd not heard talked about or even
things Summer hadn't consciously realized were different after emigrating.</p>

<p>I hope documenting them has helped you out.
If so, I'd love to hear about it on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@glacials" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to Summer for feedback on drafts of this.</em></p>

<p>I run many Obsidian plugins and they're constantly changing.
These are the ones that have stuck around.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jenningsb2/copy-as-html" target="_blank">Copy as HTML</a>

<ul>
<li>I treat this as “copy with formatting” so I can copy e.g. bulleted lists from my notes and paste them into an email to send to others; without it, the copied text is unparsed markdown</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian" target="_blank">Editor Syntax Highlight</a>

<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks, just like GitHub</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin" target="_blank">Excalidraw</a>

<ul>
<li>Unbelievably well-integrated Excalidraw support; embed drawings in notes but also let specific elements in drawings link to notes or dynamically inherit content from notes, and a lot more</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MahmoudFawzyKhalil/obsidian-global-search-and-replace" target="_blank">Global Search and Replace</a>

<ul>
<li>Does what it says on the tin; I expect this will become a first-party feature soon</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter" target="_blank">Linter</a>

<ul>
<li>Automatically apply Markdown linting on save</li>
<li>Cleans up inconsistencies like # line breaks between paragraphs, heading capitalization, re-index ordered lists, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gtg922r/obsidian-numerals" target="_blank">Numerals</a>

<ul>
<li>Adds a code block type for math, including calculating and rendering answers for each line</li>
<li>Basically Jupyter Notebooks for math; easy to show work and avoid mistakes since the answers are calculated on render</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-quickshare" target="_blank">QuickShare</a>

<ul>
<li>Publish a note to an auto-expiring shareable URL</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kemayo/obsidian-smart-links" target="_blank">Smart Links</a>

<ul>
<li>Allows specifying patterns to automatically link</li>
<li>I use it so I can write e.g. OPSFLOW-123 to link to a Jira ticket</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I use the <strong>Daily notes</strong> core plugin, which adds a button/command to create a note for today with a predesignated place and title (e.g. <code>Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md</code>). These community plugins extend that:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iiz00/obsidian-daily-note-outline" target="_blank">Daily Note Outline</a>

<ul>
<li>A single pane that shows an outline of <em>all</em> daily notes in reverse chronological order</li>
<li>I have this persistently in my right sidebar</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-daily-notes-opener" target="_blank">Daily Notes Opener</a>

<ul>
<li>Auto open today’s note when opening Obsidian</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/larslockefeer/obsidian-plugin-todo" target="_blank">Obsidian TODO</a>

<ul>
<li>Collects TODOs from all notes (daily or not) and shows them in one pane</li>
<li>This is also persistently in my right sidebar</li>
<li>These are markdown todos, which Obsidian natively supports (e.g. <code>- [ ] Go shopping</code>); for a more powerful experience look at <a href="https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks" target="_blank">Tasks</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian" target="_blank">Natural Language Dates</a>

<ul>
<li>Type e.g. <code>@yesterday</code> or <code>@tomorrow</code> to link to the daily note for those days</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanjamurphy/review-obsidian" target="_blank">Review</a>

<ul>
<li>Mark the current spot (any note, any header) as needing review at whatever date you want (e.g. tomorrow); it will be added to that day's daily note</li>
<li>For a different workflow see <a href="https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder" target="_blank">Reminder</a></li>
</ul></li>

<p>There are a small number of products in my life that, in little ways, are
life-changing. These are them.</p>

<h2>5.11 Belt</h2>

<p>I wear a belt every day.
I used to buy a new one every 1<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>2 years,
then I got <a href="https://amzn.to/3ptyErI" target="_blank">this belt</a>.</p>

<p>That was 10 years ago.
I have worn it &gt; 95% of days since then and it shows nearly no signs of wear.
I expect I will never buy another belt.</p>

<h2>Micro Four Thirds</h2>

<p>For photography folks.</p>

<p>Micro Four Thirds is a camera and lens conector.
Unlike most proprietary systems,
it's an open standard with many companies participating.
The de facto flagships are OM System (formerly Olympus) and Panasonic.</p>

<p>Its biggest advantage is its high <code>photo quality : gear size</code> ratio.
My archenemy is not having my camera with me;
every time I have to settle for my phone camera I question having a camera at all.</p>

<p>Since I switched to micro 4/3 I can fit my setup in ~half the space as before.
That means a full-day setup in a 20L backpack,
a camera + couple lenses in a 6L sling,
or a camera + lens in a 2L chest pouch.</p>

<p>I'm using the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III
(<a href="https://amzn.to/3PtUO81" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /
<a href="https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/om-d-e-m5-mark-iii" target="_blank">OM System</a>).
My everyday versatile lens is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3FxQYEP" target="_blank">Olympus M.Zuiko 14<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>150mm F4.0<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>5.6</a>.</p>

<h2>A Long, Mountable Power Strip</h2>

<p>Mounting a hilariously long power strip under every desk in my house,
paired with <a href="https://amzn.to/3XAxIPa" target="_blank">any cheap</a> cable basket,
has given me the best and easiest cable management I've ever had.</p>

<p>It's important to overbudget your outlets by ~2x and to go long, not fat,
so cables can plug in where they are instead of playing musical chairs with a rat's nest of wall warts.</p>

<p>Any will do, but I use these: <a href="https://amzn.to/44e4c3W" target="_blank">Amazon</a> /

<h2>Noctua Fans</h2>

<p>As a <a href="autism.html">noise-sensitive</a> person whose hobbies involve computers,
silence is important to me in a gaming machine.
Noctua makes giant, silent, brown fans. That's it.</p>

<p>Once I got one I could never switch back.
My build is centered around their obnoxiously large <a href="https://amzn.to/3pyrIJU" target="_blank">fanned heatsink</a>,
and has been purring for six years.
I expect to reuse the same fans for my next build, whenever it is.</p>

<h2>Jetz Scrubz Sponges</h2>

<p>These kitchen sponges are easily a 10x<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>100x improvement over the traditional sponges,
in all of these categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lifespan before getting damaged</li>
<li>Lifespan before getting permanently gross</li>
<li>Tendancy to get temporarily gross</li>
<li>Ease of cleaning once temporarily gross</li>
</ul>

<p>They're pricier upfront, but cheaper long-term.</p>

<h2>Bidets</h2>

<p>If someone came up to you in the street and smeared poop all over you,
would you wipe it off with a paper towel, or would you take a shower?</p>

<p>Before I tried one, I had three fundamental misunderstandings about bidets:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bidets are separate from toilets.</li>
<li>Bidets are expensive.</li>
<li>It's a big deal to install a bidet.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>None of these is true.</strong>
It takes about 15 minutes to install a bidet onto your toilet,
and you can get one for <a href="https://amzn.to/3McRz2a" target="_blank">under fifty bucks</a>.
It's just a piece of plastic that goes between the toilet and the seat.
You do not need to put your hands inside the toilet bowl to install it.</p>

<p>Bidets pay for themselves in unused toilet paper.
I use between 1<span style="font-family: sans-serif">–</span>10% of the toilet paper I used before.
Its only function now is drying.</p>

<p>Bidets feel weird for about 10 seconds, then never again.
It's honestly disgusting <em>not</em> to use one now.</p>

<p>Buy whichever one makes you try it, but here are some options:</p>

<ul>
<li>($) <a href="https://amzn.to/3McRz2a" target="_blank">Attachment</a>:
Simple, replaces nothing about your toilet, sprays cold water only.
I promise it doesn't feel like a cold shower.
That area of your body doesn't experience temperature the same.</li>
<li>($$) <a href="https://amzn.to/3PYqFwc" target="_blank">Seat</a>:
The weight distribution of my seat got worse with just an attachment,
so a combination seat/bidet is something to consider if that bugs you.
Otherwise, the functions are ~the same as the attachment.</li>
<li>($$$) <a href="https://amzn.to/3S9PBn9" target="_blank">Air Dry</a>;
Seats that plug in jump in price and feature set drastically,
but I think air dry is the only big one to consider.
Warm water is overrated.
If you're not sure if you need a heated seat, you don't.</li>
</ul>

<h1>In Search Of</h1>

<p>I'm in search of a life-changing product for these categories. Please <a href="mailto:ben@twos.dev">email
me</a> if you have recommendations.</p>

<h2>Water Bottle</h2>

<p>I am in search of a reusable water bottle with the following qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can last 10+ years</li>
<li>Can last a week of no washing without getting funky</li>
<li>Is less than ~9cm in diameter (i.e. a comfortable size for a Peak Design Everyday
Backpack V1 20L cup holder)</li>
<li>Holds about 1L</li>
<li>Attached or attachable lid</li>
<li>Ability to stay cold ~1 day preferred</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest I ever came was the <a href="https://amzn.to/42XJaoR" target="_blank">Thermos Element 5 32 oz</a>, but
I lost mine and the product has since discontinued.</p>

<h2>Hair Trimmer</h2>

<p>I am in search of a combination beard and head trimmer with these qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can last 3+ years</li>
<li>USB-C chargeable</li>
<li>Has two or fewer attachments, or a good organization system for attachments</li>
<li>Can trim beards in the 1~6mm range</li>
<li>Can trim head hair in the 1~3cm range</li>
<li>Requires no more than two passes for reasonable coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest I've found in my research is the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3rFxMBB" target="_blank">MANSCAPED Beard Hedger</a>,
but it seems to need five or more passes for good coverage.</p>

<p>Do more things at 90% effort. If you believe you can only choose 0% or 100%, you’ll
often choose 0% because you cannot afford 100%.</p>

<p>I became very engaged in helping with the climate emergency in the last couple of years. One big line item on the list of emitters is meat. A 100g serving of beef emits the equivalent of <a href="https://www.co2everything.com/co2e-of/beef" target="_blank">15kg</a> of CO₂ into the atmosphere, the same as driving 78km (48mi). A 100g serving of tofu emits 0.08 kg of CO₂ equivalent.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:CO-equivalent-CO"><a href="#fn:CO-equivalent-CO">1</a></sup> In other words, a week of eating beef emits more CO₂e than three years of eating tofu.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3x-meals-daily-o"><a href="#fn:3x-meals-daily-o">2</a></sup></p>

<p>For someone wanting to reduce emissions, vegetarianism is a clear candidate. But there are some things about being vegetarian I can't do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Summer is deeply carnivorous and I don't want to put her through the effects of my choice (we did try).</li>
<li>I don't want to be that person in the friend group people have to plan around, the person whose presence at a barbecue makes an unprepared host feel guilty.</li>
<li>There are formats of meat I get occasional cravings for, like a burger or a ball park hot dog.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can't be 100% vegetarian. But that's no reason to stay at 0%. I can cut meat from the ~90% of meals that don't cause any of these issues.</p>

<p>So I became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexitarianism" target="_blank">flexitarian</a> which for me means "vegetarian except when it would inconvenience people". If 90% of the world could become 90% vegetarian the benefit would be nearly that of 100%/100% but orders of magnitude easier to achieve.</p>

<p>We need to adopt this strategy more. It's similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/80-20_rule" target="_blank">80/20 rule</a>, but 80/20 optimizes bang-for-buck when building things. 90 &gt; 100 is about recognizing that <code>impact per success</code> is a worse thing to optimize for than <code>success rate * impact per success</code>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:CO-equivalent-CO">CO₂ equivalent ("CO₂e") is how we describe climate change impact in a way agnostic to the method. For example cows emit methane, which impacts the climate in a far greater way than CO₂.</li>

<p>We are not rational creatures. We have irrational fears, hates, beliefs, biases. There are entire fields of study on these irrationalities. Those fields are still discovering new ways our brains fail us.</p>

<p>When we pit form against function, we ignore this. We put function in the light of getting things done, and form in the light of looking pretty for... reasons?</p>

<p>Form<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>design<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>does a lot. For the sake of argument, let's boil it down to its essence: it makes products enjoyable.</p>

<p>Enjoyability has utility.</p>

<h2>Anticlutter</h2>

<p>When I'm in a messy space, it gets in my head. I become anxious and distracted, but not enough to realize it. I don't know there's a problem to be fixed.</p>

<p>When I happen to fix it by tidying my space, I sit down in my chair and feel peace and productivity wash over me. In this space and headspace the creative possibilities lay themselves in front of me. The doodads are in their places, the surfaces are ready to be used. I am calm. I am concentrated, ready to take on a challenge.</p>

<p>This makes no sense I can gather. Maybe at some evolutionary stage it paid to have a clean space, or maybe it's a byproduct of some other evolutionary development. Today it really shouldn't matter if I have a couple of things scattered about.</p>

<p>But it does. We must learn "it shouldn't matter" does not mean "it doesn't matter". You don't go to the users who fell out of your funnel and explain why they're being irrational. You fix the funnel.</p>

<p>We need to build our own funnels around our own brains' irrationalities.</p>

<h2>Interior Design</h2>

<p>I took it one step further than clutter started learning to make a space itself invoke this feeling, rather than just the objects that exist inside it. This is how I started my interior design kick.</p>

<p>If you thought sitting down in a newly tidied space was irrationally motivating, wait until you sit down in a well designed space. Even learning the basics of color theory throws an alleged rational mind for a twist. Learn about <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/" target="_blank">the silly irrational rules</a> for good vs. bad color pairings and then notice that actually, the supposed good pairings <em>do</em> look better.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>It has never been form vs. function. Form is a category of function. It is the category focused on the subtleties we don't realize we enjoy. And enjoyment has utility.</p>

<p>I am more productive in a space with good form than in a space with bad form. This applies to more than just physical spaces. After twelve years on Android, switching to iPhone had that unnamed UX feeling of peace and motivation. The design handbook permeates the OS and nearly all popular apps. It's enjoyable to just use the OS.</p>

<p>The biggest prank here is you can't quite express why. I'm not even sure that I have on this page. People criticize Apple users for spending <code>$MONEY</code> on <code>$SPEC_SHEET</code> when they could have spent less on more, and for choosing a locked-down experience over a customizable one. Apple users suck at arguing against this because all the reasons they like Apple products are inherently nonsensical. They're inbuilt traits of us as a species, but not something allowed in rational conversation.</p>

<p>Let us acknowledge that our species has irrationalities and not be ashamed of them. Eating sweet desserts, seeking out sweeping landscapes, engaging in nonproductive sex<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>these are all irrational nonsensical behaviors fueled by evolutionary leftovers, and acknowledging they can be irrational and also real is our only way to continue the conversation around them.</p>
