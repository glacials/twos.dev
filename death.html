<p>In Sweden there is a concept called döstädning, or death cleaning. This is the practice of cleaning your house and belongings such that if you died tomorrow, your next-of-kin would have a pleasant, not burdensome, time cleaning up your things. It can be used in the contexts of end-of-life planning, sure, but I’ve found it useful even as an exercise in increasing what I’d call “meaning density” among my things.</p>

<p>"End of life planning", or continuity, is something familiar to the professions of law and medicine. But these professions deal with inheritances and end-of life care, not with day-to-day items like your six spatulas or the scattered change in your kitchen drawer.</p>

<p>As an engineer I want to have some of the more technical aspects of my life handled in a more technical manner.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://splits.io">side</a> [projects][whatsinstandard], for example, serve a combined ~25k users per month. I would hate to get hit by a bus and have their respective stacks slowly fall over as bills go unpaid and content stops getting updated.</p>

<p>At the same time, I don't want to burden others with the responsibility of caring for a project they don't care about. For these reasons, I've decided to get serious about "continuity planning" for the tech I've written after I'm gone.</p>

<h1>Access Needed by Successors</h1>

<ul>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Infrastructure

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Money

<ul>
<li>Discovery: where is our money, generally?</li>
<li>Instruction: why was I doing what I was doing with our money?</li>
<li>Access: Probably unneeded because law handles this, but can be expedited by me</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Storage</h1>

<p>I'm not looking to keep an ever-growing file folder of 2FA backup codes.</p>

<h1>Security</h1>

<p>One of the most interesting questions is how to give someone full administrator access after you've gone, but not before. Lawyers and wills are great at <em>delivering</em> postmortem information reliably, but I wouldn't trust that system to <em>secure</em> it reliably, at least to my standards.</p>

<p>So, we will need some automated mechanism to release the keys. It's okay for this mechanism to be triggered by law such as a will, but not for it to be easy to silently steal (such as a private key written on a piece of paper in a filing cabinet).</p>

<h2>Impersonation vs. authentication</h2>

<p>There is also the choice of whether to deliver your own private keys and passwords to a trustee, or to do it the "proper" way by promoting their own account to administrator and then self-destructing yours.</p>

<p>Although proper authentication feels like the correct way to do things, it comes with significant initial &amp; ongoing effort, and adds a whole lot of complexity, for not much tangible benefit other than some improved UX for the trustee. The complexity is reason enough to say no here<span style="font-family: sans-serif">—</span>we want our delivery to be as simple as possible to reduce the chance of errors.</p>
